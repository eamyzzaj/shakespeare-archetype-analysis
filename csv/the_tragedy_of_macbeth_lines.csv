The Tragedy of Macbeth,1,3,ROSS,1,"The king hath happily received, Macbeth,"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,1,3,ROSS,2,The news of thy success; and when he reads
The Tragedy of Macbeth,1,3,ROSS,3,"Thy personal venture in the rebels' fight,"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,1,3,ROSS,4,His wonders and his praises do contend
The Tragedy of Macbeth,1,3,ROSS,5,"Which should be thine or his: silenced with that,"

The Tragedy of Macbeth,1,3,ROSS,8,"Nothing afeard of what thyself didst make,"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,1,3,ROSS,9,Strange images of death. As thick as hail

The Tragedy of Macbeth,1,3,ROSS,11,"Thy praises in his kingdom's great defence,"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,1,3,ROSS,12,And pour'd them down before him.
The Tragedy of Macbeth,1,3,ANGUS,1,We are sent
The Tragedy of Macbeth,1,3,ANGUS,2,To give thee from our royal master thanks;
The Tragedy of Macbeth,1,3,ANGUS,3,"Only to herald thee into his sight,"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,1,3,ANGUS,4,Not pay thee.
The Tragedy of Macbeth,1,3,ROSS,1,"And, for an earnest of a greater honour,"

The Tragedy of Macbeth,1,3,ROSS,4,For it is thine.
The Tragedy of Macbeth,1,3,BANQUO,1,"What, can the devil speak true?"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,1,3,MACBETH,1,The thane of Cawdor lives: why do you dress me
The Tragedy of Macbeth,1,3,MACBETH,2,In borrow'd robes?
The Tragedy of Macbeth,1,3,ANGUS,1,Who was the thane lives yet;
The Tragedy of Macbeth,1,3,ANGUS,2,But under heavy judgment bears that life
The Tragedy of Macbeth,1,3,ANGUS,3,Which he deserves to lose. Whether he was combined
The Tragedy of Macbeth,1,3,ANGUS,4,"With those of Norway, or did line the rebel"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,1,3,ANGUS,5,"With hidden help and vantage, or that with both"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,1,3,ANGUS,6,"He labour'd in his country's wreck, I know not;"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,1,3,ANGUS,7,"But treasons capital, confess'd and proved,"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,1,3,ANGUS,8,Have overthrown him.
The Tragedy of Macbeth,1,3,MACBETH,1,The greatest is behind.
The Tragedy of Macbeth,1,3,MACBETH,2,Thanks for your pains.
The Tragedy of Macbeth,1,3,MACBETH,3,"Do you not hope your children shall be kings,"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,1,3,MACBETH,4,When those that gave the thane of Cawdor to me
The Tragedy of Macbeth,1,3,MACBETH,5,Promised no less to them?
The Tragedy of Macbeth,1,3,BANQUO,1,That trusted home
The Tragedy of Macbeth,1,3,BANQUO,2,"Might yet enkindle you unto the crown,"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,1,3,BANQUO,3,Besides the thane of Cawdor. But 'tis strange:
The Tragedy of Macbeth,1,3,BANQUO,4,"And oftentimes, to win us to our harm,"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,1,3,BANQUO,5,"The instruments of darkness tell us truths,"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,1,3,BANQUO,6,"Win us with honest trifles, to betray's"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,1,3,BANQUO,7,In deepest consequence.
The Tragedy of Macbeth,1,3,BANQUO,8,"Cousins, a word, I pray you."
The Tragedy of Macbeth,1,3,MACBETH,1,As happy prologues to the swelling act
The Tragedy of Macbeth,1,3,MACBETH,2,"Of the imperial theme.--I thank you, gentlemen."
The Tragedy of Macbeth,1,3,MACBETH,3,"Cannot be ill, cannot be good: if ill,"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,1,3,MACBETH,4,"Why hath it given me earnest of success,"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,1,3,MACBETH,5,Commencing in a truth? I am thane of Cawdor:
The Tragedy of Macbeth,1,3,MACBETH,6,"If good, why do I yield to that suggestion"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,1,3,MACBETH,7,Whose horrid image doth unfix my hair
The Tragedy of Macbeth,1,3,MACBETH,8,"And make my seated heart knock at my ribs,"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,1,3,MACBETH,9,Against the use of nature? Present fears
The Tragedy of Macbeth,1,3,MACBETH,10,Are less than horrible imaginings:
The Tragedy of Macbeth,1,3,MACBETH,11,"My thought, whose murder yet is but fantastical,"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,1,3,MACBETH,12,Shakes so my single state of man that function
The Tragedy of Macbeth,1,3,MACBETH,13,"Is smother'd in surmise, and nothing is"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,1,3,MACBETH,14,But what is not.
The Tragedy of Macbeth,1,3,BANQUO,1,"Look, how our partner's rapt."
The Tragedy of Macbeth,1,3,MACBETH,1,Without my stir.
The Tragedy of Macbeth,1,3,BANQUO,1,"New horrors come upon him,"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,1,3,BANQUO,2,"Like our strange garments, cleave not to their mould"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,1,3,BANQUO,3,But with the aid of use.
The Tragedy of Macbeth,1,3,MACBETH,1,Time and the hour runs through the roughest day.
The Tragedy of Macbeth,1,3,BANQUO,1,"Worthy Macbeth, we stay upon your leisure."
The Tragedy of Macbeth,1,3,MACBETH,1,Give me your favour: my dull brain was wrought
The Tragedy of Macbeth,1,3,MACBETH,2,"With things forgotten. Kind gentlemen, your pains"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,1,3,MACBETH,3,Are register'd where every day I turn
The Tragedy of Macbeth,1,3,MACBETH,4,The leaf to read them. Let us toward the king.
The Tragedy of Macbeth,1,3,MACBETH,5,"Think upon what hath chanced, and, at more time,"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,1,3,MACBETH,6,"The interim having weigh'd it, let us speak"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,1,3,MACBETH,7,Our free hearts each to other.
The Tragedy of Macbeth,1,3,BANQUO,1,Very gladly.
The Tragedy of Macbeth,1,3,MACBETH,1,"Till then, enough. Come, friends."
The Tragedy of Macbeth,1,4,DUNCAN,1,Is execution done on Cawdor? Are not
The Tragedy of Macbeth,1,4,DUNCAN,2,Those in commission yet return'd?
The Tragedy of Macbeth,1,4,MALCOLM,1,"My liege,"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,1,4,MALCOLM,2,They are not yet come back. But I have spoke
The Tragedy of Macbeth,1,4,MALCOLM,3,With one that saw him die: who did report
The Tragedy of Macbeth,1,4,MALCOLM,4,"That very frankly he confess'd his treasons,"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,1,4,MALCOLM,5,Implored your highness' pardon and set forth
The Tragedy of Macbeth,1,4,MALCOLM,6,A deep repentance: nothing in his life
The Tragedy of Macbeth,1,4,MALCOLM,7,Became him like the leaving it; he died
The Tragedy of Macbeth,1,4,MALCOLM,8,As one that had been studied in his death
The Tragedy of Macbeth,1,4,MALCOLM,9,"To throw away the dearest thing he owed,"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,1,4,MALCOLM,10,As 'twere a careless trifle.
The Tragedy of Macbeth,1,4,DUNCAN,1,There's no art
The Tragedy of Macbeth,1,4,DUNCAN,2,To find the mind's construction in the face:
The Tragedy of Macbeth,1,4,DUNCAN,3,He was a gentleman on whom I built
The Tragedy of Macbeth,1,4,DUNCAN,4,An absolute trust.
The Tragedy of Macbeth,1,4,DUNCAN,5,O worthiest cousin!
The Tragedy of Macbeth,1,4,DUNCAN,6,The sin of my ingratitude even now
The Tragedy of Macbeth,1,4,DUNCAN,7,Was heavy on me: thou art so far before
The Tragedy of Macbeth,1,4,DUNCAN,8,That swiftest wing of recompense is slow
The Tragedy of Macbeth,1,4,DUNCAN,9,"To overtake thee. Would thou hadst less deserved,"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,1,4,DUNCAN,10,That the proportion both of thanks and payment
The Tragedy of Macbeth,1,4,DUNCAN,11,"Might have been mine! only I have left to say,"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,1,4,DUNCAN,12,More is thy due than more than all can pay.
The Tragedy of Macbeth,1,4,MACBETH,1,"The service and the loyalty I owe,"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,1,4,MACBETH,2,"In doing it, pays itself. Your highness' part"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,1,4,MACBETH,3,Is to receive our duties; and our duties
The Tragedy of Macbeth,1,4,MACBETH,4,"Are to your throne and state children and servants,"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,1,4,MACBETH,5,"Which do but what they should, by doing every thing"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,1,4,MACBETH,6,Safe toward your love and honour.

The Tragedy of Macbeth,1,4,DUNCAN,6,And hold thee to my heart.
The Tragedy of Macbeth,1,4,BANQUO,1,"There if I grow,"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,1,4,BANQUO,2,The harvest is your own.
The Tragedy of Macbeth,1,4,DUNCAN,1,"My plenteous joys,"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,1,4,DUNCAN,2,"Wanton in fulness, seek to hide themselves"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,1,4,DUNCAN,3,"In drops of sorrow. Sons, kinsmen, thanes,"

The Tragedy of Macbeth,1,4,DUNCAN,5,We will establish our estate upon
The Tragedy of Macbeth,1,4,DUNCAN,6,"Our eldest, Malcolm, whom we name hereafter"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,1,4,DUNCAN,7,The Prince of Cumberland; which honour must
The Tragedy of Macbeth,1,4,DUNCAN,8,"Not unaccompanied invest him only,"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,1,4,DUNCAN,9,"But signs of nobleness, like stars, shall shine"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,1,4,DUNCAN,10,"On all deservers. From hence to Inverness,"

The Tragedy of Macbeth,1,4,MACBETH,1,"On which I must fall down, or else o'erleap,"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,1,4,MACBETH,2,"For in my way it lies. Stars, hide your fires;"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,1,4,MACBETH,3,Let not light see my black and deep desires:
The Tragedy of Macbeth,1,4,MACBETH,4,"The eye wink at the hand; yet let that be,"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,1,4,MACBETH,5,"Which the eye fears, when it is done, to see."
The Tragedy of Macbeth,1,4,DUNCAN,1,"True, worthy Banquo; he is full so valiant,"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,1,4,DUNCAN,2,And in his commendations I am fed;
The Tragedy of Macbeth,1,4,DUNCAN,3,"It is a banquet to me. Let's after him,"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,1,4,DUNCAN,4,Whose care is gone before to bid us welcome:
The Tragedy of Macbeth,1,4,DUNCAN,5,It is a peerless kinsman.
The Tragedy of Macbeth,1,5,LADY MACBETH,1,'They met me in the day of success: and I have
The Tragedy of Macbeth,1,5,LADY MACBETH,2,"learned by the perfectest report, they have more in"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,1,5,LADY MACBETH,3,them than mortal knowledge. When I burned in desire
The Tragedy of Macbeth,1,5,LADY MACBETH,4,"to question them further, they made themselves air,"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,1,5,LADY MACBETH,5,into which they vanished. Whiles I stood rapt in
The Tragedy of Macbeth,1,5,LADY MACBETH,6,"the wonder of it, came missives from the king, who"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,1,5,LADY MACBETH,7,"all-hailed me 'Thane of Cawdor;' by which title,"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,1,5,LADY MACBETH,8,"before, these weird sisters saluted me, and referred"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,1,5,LADY MACBETH,9,"me to the coming on of time, with 'Hail, king that"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,1,5,LADY MACBETH,10,shalt be!' This have I thought good to deliver
The Tragedy of Macbeth,1,5,LADY MACBETH,11,"thee, my dearest partner of greatness, that thou"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,1,5,LADY MACBETH,12,"mightst not lose the dues of rejoicing, by being"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,1,5,LADY MACBETH,13,ignorant of what greatness is promised thee. Lay it
The Tragedy of Macbeth,1,5,LADY MACBETH,14,"to thy heart, and farewell.'"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,1,5,LADY MACBETH,15,"Glamis thou art, and Cawdor; and shalt be"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,1,5,LADY MACBETH,16,What thou art promised: yet do I fear thy nature;
The Tragedy of Macbeth,1,5,LADY MACBETH,17,It is too full o' the milk of human kindness
The Tragedy of Macbeth,1,5,LADY MACBETH,18,To catch the nearest way: thou wouldst be great;
The Tragedy of Macbeth,1,5,LADY MACBETH,19,"Art not without ambition, but without"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,1,5,LADY MACBETH,20,"The illness should attend it: what thou wouldst highly,"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,1,5,LADY MACBETH,21,"That wouldst thou holily; wouldst not play false,"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,1,5,LADY MACBETH,22,"And yet wouldst wrongly win: thou'ldst have, great Glamis,"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,1,5,LADY MACBETH,23,"That which cries 'Thus thou must do, if thou have it;"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,1,5,LADY MACBETH,24,And that which rather thou dost fear to do
The Tragedy of Macbeth,1,5,LADY MACBETH,25,"Than wishest should be undone.' Hie thee hither,"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,1,5,LADY MACBETH,26,That I may pour my spirits in thine ear;
The Tragedy of Macbeth,1,5,LADY MACBETH,27,And chastise with the valour of my tongue
The Tragedy of Macbeth,1,5,LADY MACBETH,28,"All that impedes thee from the golden round,"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,1,5,LADY MACBETH,29,Which fate and metaphysical aid doth seem
The Tragedy of Macbeth,1,5,LADY MACBETH,30,To have thee crown'd withal.
The Tragedy of Macbeth,1,5,LADY MACBETH,31,What is your tidings?
The Tragedy of Macbeth,1,5,MESSENGER,1,The king comes here to-night.
The Tragedy of Macbeth,1,5,LADY MACBETH,1,Thou'rt mad to say it:
The Tragedy of Macbeth,1,5,LADY MACBETH,2,"Is not thy master with him? who, were't so,"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,1,5,LADY MACBETH,3,Would have inform'd for preparation.
The Tragedy of Macbeth,1,5,MESSENGER,1,"So please you, it is true: our thane is coming:"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,1,5,MESSENGER,2,"One of my fellows had the speed of him,"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,1,5,MESSENGER,3,"Who, almost dead for breath, had scarcely more"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,1,5,MESSENGER,4,Than would make up his message.
The Tragedy of Macbeth,1,5,LADY MACBETH,1,Give him tending;
The Tragedy of Macbeth,1,5,LADY MACBETH,2,He brings great news.
The Tragedy of Macbeth,1,5,LADY MACBETH,3,The raven himself is hoarse
The Tragedy of Macbeth,1,5,LADY MACBETH,4,That croaks the fatal entrance of Duncan
The Tragedy of Macbeth,1,5,LADY MACBETH,5,"Under my battlements. Come, you spirits"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,1,5,LADY MACBETH,6,"That tend on mortal thoughts, unsex me here,"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,1,5,LADY MACBETH,7,And fill me from the crown to the toe top-full
The Tragedy of Macbeth,1,5,LADY MACBETH,8,Of direst cruelty! make thick my blood;
The Tragedy of Macbeth,1,5,LADY MACBETH,9,"Stop up the access and passage to remorse,"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,1,5,LADY MACBETH,10,That no compunctious visitings of nature
The Tragedy of Macbeth,1,5,LADY MACBETH,11,"Shake my fell purpose, nor keep peace between"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,1,5,LADY MACBETH,12,"The effect and it! Come to my woman's breasts,"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,1,5,LADY MACBETH,13,"And take my milk for gall, you murdering ministers,"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,1,5,LADY MACBETH,14,Wherever in your sightless substances
The Tragedy of Macbeth,1,5,LADY MACBETH,15,"You wait on nature's mischief! Come, thick night,"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,1,5,LADY MACBETH,16,"And pall thee in the dunnest smoke of hell,"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,1,5,LADY MACBETH,17,"That my keen knife see not the wound it makes,"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,1,5,LADY MACBETH,18,"Nor heaven peep through the blanket of the dark,"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,1,5,LADY MACBETH,19,"To cry 'Hold, hold!'"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,1,5,LADY MACBETH,20,Great Glamis! worthy Cawdor!
The Tragedy of Macbeth,1,5,LADY MACBETH,21,"Greater than both, by the all-hail hereafter!"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,1,5,LADY MACBETH,22,Thy letters have transported me beyond
The Tragedy of Macbeth,1,5,LADY MACBETH,23,"This ignorant present, and I feel now"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,1,5,LADY MACBETH,24,The future in the instant.
The Tragedy of Macbeth,1,5,MACBETH,1,"My dearest love,"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,1,5,MACBETH,2,Duncan comes here to-night.
The Tragedy of Macbeth,1,5,LADY MACBETH,1,And when goes hence?
The Tragedy of Macbeth,1,5,MACBETH,1,"To-morrow, as he purposes."
The Tragedy of Macbeth,1,5,LADY MACBETH,1,"O, never"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,1,5,LADY MACBETH,2,Shall sun that morrow see!
The Tragedy of Macbeth,1,5,LADY MACBETH,3,"Your face, my thane, is as a book where men"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,1,5,LADY MACBETH,4,"May read strange matters. To beguile the time,"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,1,5,LADY MACBETH,5,"Look like the time; bear welcome in your eye,"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,1,5,LADY MACBETH,6,"Your hand, your tongue: look like the innocent flower,"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,1,5,LADY MACBETH,7,But be the serpent under't. He that's coming
The Tragedy of Macbeth,1,5,LADY MACBETH,8,Must be provided for: and you shall put
The Tragedy of Macbeth,1,5,LADY MACBETH,9,This night's great business into my dispatch;
The Tragedy of Macbeth,1,5,LADY MACBETH,10,Which shall to all our nights and days to come
The Tragedy of Macbeth,1,5,LADY MACBETH,11,Give solely sovereign sway and masterdom.
The Tragedy of Macbeth,1,5,MACBETH,1,We will speak further.
The Tragedy of Macbeth,1,5,LADY MACBETH,1,Only look up clear;
The Tragedy of Macbeth,1,5,LADY MACBETH,2,To alter favour ever is to fear:
The Tragedy of Macbeth,1,5,LADY MACBETH,3,Leave all the rest to me.
The Tragedy of Macbeth,1,6,DUNCAN,1,This castle hath a pleasant seat; the air
The Tragedy of Macbeth,1,6,DUNCAN,2,Nimbly and sweetly recommends itself
The Tragedy of Macbeth,1,6,DUNCAN,3,Unto our gentle senses.
The Tragedy of Macbeth,1,6,BANQUO,1,"This guest of summer,"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,1,6,BANQUO,2,"The temple-haunting martlet, does approve,"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,1,6,BANQUO,3,"By his loved mansionry, that the heaven's breath"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,1,6,BANQUO,4,"Smells wooingly here: no jutty, frieze,"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,1,6,BANQUO,5,"Buttress, nor coign of vantage, but this bird"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,1,6,BANQUO,6,Hath made his pendent bed and procreant cradle:
The Tragedy of Macbeth,1,6,BANQUO,7,"Where they most breed and haunt, I have observed,"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,1,6,BANQUO,8,The air is delicate.
The Tragedy of Macbeth,1,6,DUNCAN,1,"See, see, our honour'd hostess!"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,1,6,DUNCAN,2,"The love that follows us sometime is our trouble,"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,1,6,DUNCAN,3,Which still we thank as love. Herein I teach you
The Tragedy of Macbeth,1,6,DUNCAN,4,"How you shall bid God 'ild us for your pains,"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,1,6,DUNCAN,5,And thank us for your trouble.
The Tragedy of Macbeth,1,6,LADY MACBETH,1,All our service
The Tragedy of Macbeth,1,6,LADY MACBETH,2,In every point twice done and then done double
The Tragedy of Macbeth,1,6,LADY MACBETH,3,Were poor and single business to contend
The Tragedy of Macbeth,1,6,LADY MACBETH,4,Against those honours deep and broad wherewith
The Tragedy of Macbeth,1,6,LADY MACBETH,5,"Your majesty loads our house: for those of old,"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,1,6,LADY MACBETH,6,"And the late dignities heap'd up to them,"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,1,6,LADY MACBETH,7,We rest your hermits.
The Tragedy of Macbeth,1,6,DUNCAN,1,Where's the thane of Cawdor?
The Tragedy of Macbeth,1,6,DUNCAN,2,"We coursed him at the heels, and had a purpose"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,1,6,DUNCAN,3,To be his purveyor: but he rides well;
The Tragedy of Macbeth,1,6,DUNCAN,4,"And his great love, sharp as his spur, hath holp him"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,1,6,DUNCAN,5,"To his home before us. Fair and noble hostess,"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,1,6,DUNCAN,6,We are your guest to-night.
The Tragedy of Macbeth,1,6,LADY MACBETH,1,Your servants ever
The Tragedy of Macbeth,1,6,LADY MACBETH,2,"Have theirs, themselves and what is theirs, in compt,"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,1,6,LADY MACBETH,3,"To make their audit at your highness' pleasure,"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,1,6,LADY MACBETH,4,Still to return your own.
The Tragedy of Macbeth,1,6,DUNCAN,1,Give me your hand;
The Tragedy of Macbeth,1,6,DUNCAN,2,"Conduct me to mine host: we love him highly,"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,1,6,DUNCAN,3,And shall continue our graces towards him.
The Tragedy of Macbeth,1,6,DUNCAN,4,"By your leave, hostess."
The Tragedy of Macbeth,1,7,MACBETH,1,"If it were done when 'tis done, then 'twere well"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,1,7,MACBETH,2,It were done quickly: if the assassination
The Tragedy of Macbeth,1,7,MACBETH,3,"Could trammel up the consequence, and catch"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,1,7,MACBETH,4,With his surcease success; that but this blow
The Tragedy of Macbeth,1,7,MACBETH,5,"Might be the be-all and the end-all here,"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,1,7,MACBETH,6,"But here, upon this bank and shoal of time,"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,1,7,MACBETH,7,We'ld jump the life to come. But in these cases
The Tragedy of Macbeth,1,7,MACBETH,8,We still have judgment here; that we but teach
The Tragedy of Macbeth,1,7,MACBETH,9,"Bloody instructions, which, being taught, return"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,1,7,MACBETH,10,To plague the inventor: this even-handed justice
The Tragedy of Macbeth,1,7,MACBETH,11,Commends the ingredients of our poison'd chalice
The Tragedy of Macbeth,1,7,MACBETH,12,To our own lips. He's here in double trust;
The Tragedy of Macbeth,1,7,MACBETH,13,"First, as I am his kinsman and his subject,"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,1,7,MACBETH,14,"Strong both against the deed; then, as his host,"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,1,7,MACBETH,15,"Who should against his murderer shut the door,"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,1,7,MACBETH,16,"Not bear the knife myself. Besides, this Duncan"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,1,7,MACBETH,17,"Hath borne his faculties so meek, hath been"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,1,7,MACBETH,18,"So clear in his great office, that his virtues"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,1,7,MACBETH,19,"Will plead like angels, trumpet-tongued, against"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,1,7,MACBETH,20,The deep damnation of his taking-off;
The Tragedy of Macbeth,1,7,MACBETH,21,"And pity, like a naked new-born babe,"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,1,7,MACBETH,22,"Striding the blast, or heaven's cherubim, horsed"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,1,7,MACBETH,23,"Upon the sightless couriers of the air,"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,1,7,MACBETH,24,"Shall blow the horrid deed in every eye,"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,1,7,MACBETH,25,That tears shall drown the wind. I have no spur
The Tragedy of Macbeth,1,7,MACBETH,26,"To prick the sides of my intent, but only"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,1,7,MACBETH,27,"Vaulting ambition, which o'erleaps itself"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,1,7,MACBETH,28,And falls on the other.
The Tragedy of Macbeth,1,7,MACBETH,29,How now! what news?
The Tragedy of Macbeth,1,7,LADY MACBETH,1,He has almost supp'd: why have you left the chamber?
The Tragedy of Macbeth,1,7,MACBETH,1,Hath he ask'd for me?
The Tragedy of Macbeth,1,7,LADY MACBETH,1,Know you not he has?
The Tragedy of Macbeth,1,7,MACBETH,1,We will proceed no further in this business:
The Tragedy of Macbeth,1,7,MACBETH,2,He hath honour'd me of late; and I have bought
The Tragedy of Macbeth,1,7,MACBETH,3,"Golden opinions from all sorts of people,"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,1,7,MACBETH,4,"Which would be worn now in their newest gloss,"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,1,7,MACBETH,5,Not cast aside so soon.
The Tragedy of Macbeth,1,7,LADY MACBETH,1,Was the hope drunk
The Tragedy of Macbeth,1,7,LADY MACBETH,2,Wherein you dress'd yourself? hath it slept since?
The Tragedy of Macbeth,1,7,LADY MACBETH,3,"And wakes it now, to look so green and pale"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,1,7,LADY MACBETH,4,At what it did so freely? From this time
The Tragedy of Macbeth,1,7,LADY MACBETH,5,Such I account thy love. Art thou afeard
The Tragedy of Macbeth,1,7,LADY MACBETH,6,To be the same in thine own act and valour
The Tragedy of Macbeth,1,7,LADY MACBETH,7,As thou art in desire? Wouldst thou have that
The Tragedy of Macbeth,1,7,LADY MACBETH,8,"Which thou esteem'st the ornament of life,"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,1,7,LADY MACBETH,9,"And live a coward in thine own esteem,"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,1,7,LADY MACBETH,10,"Letting 'I dare not' wait upon 'I would,'"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,1,7,LADY MACBETH,11,Like the poor cat i' the adage?
The Tragedy of Macbeth,1,7,MACBETH,1,"Prithee, peace:"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,1,7,MACBETH,2,I dare do all that may become a man;
The Tragedy of Macbeth,1,7,MACBETH,3,Who dares do more is none.
The Tragedy of Macbeth,1,7,LADY MACBETH,1,"What beast was't, then,"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,1,7,LADY MACBETH,2,That made you break this enterprise to me?
The Tragedy of Macbeth,1,7,LADY MACBETH,3,"When you durst do it, then you were a man;"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,1,7,LADY MACBETH,4,"And, to be more than what you were, you would"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,1,7,LADY MACBETH,5,Be so much more the man. Nor time nor place
The Tragedy of Macbeth,1,7,LADY MACBETH,6,"Did then adhere, and yet you would make both:"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,1,7,LADY MACBETH,7,"They have made themselves, and that their fitness now"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,1,7,LADY MACBETH,8,"Does unmake you. I have given suck, and know"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,1,7,LADY MACBETH,9,How tender 'tis to love the babe that milks me:
The Tragedy of Macbeth,1,7,LADY MACBETH,10,"I would, while it was smiling in my face,"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,1,7,LADY MACBETH,11,"Have pluck'd my nipple from his boneless gums,"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,1,7,LADY MACBETH,12,"And dash'd the brains out, had I so sworn as you"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,1,7,LADY MACBETH,13,Have done to this.
The Tragedy of Macbeth,1,7,MACBETH,1,If we should fail?
The Tragedy of Macbeth,1,7,LADY MACBETH,1,We fail!
The Tragedy of Macbeth,1,7,LADY MACBETH,2,"But screw your courage to the sticking-place,"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,1,7,LADY MACBETH,3,And we'll not fail. When Duncan is asleep--
The Tragedy of Macbeth,1,7,LADY MACBETH,4,Whereto the rather shall his day's hard journey
The Tragedy of Macbeth,1,7,LADY MACBETH,5,Soundly invite him--his two chamberlains
The Tragedy of Macbeth,1,7,LADY MACBETH,6,Will I with wine and wassail so convince
The Tragedy of Macbeth,1,7,LADY MACBETH,7,"That memory, the warder of the brain,"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,1,7,LADY MACBETH,8,"Shall be a fume, and the receipt of reason"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,1,7,LADY MACBETH,9,A limbeck only: when in swinish sleep
The Tragedy of Macbeth,1,7,LADY MACBETH,10,"Their drenched natures lie as in a death,"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,1,7,LADY MACBETH,11,What cannot you and I perform upon
The Tragedy of Macbeth,1,7,LADY MACBETH,12,The unguarded Duncan? what not put upon
The Tragedy of Macbeth,1,7,LADY MACBETH,13,"His spongy officers, who shall bear the guilt"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,1,7,LADY MACBETH,14,Of our great quell?
The Tragedy of Macbeth,1,7,MACBETH,1,Bring forth men-children only;
The Tragedy of Macbeth,1,7,MACBETH,2,For thy undaunted mettle should compose
The Tragedy of Macbeth,1,7,MACBETH,3,"Nothing but males. Will it not be received,"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,1,7,MACBETH,4,When we have mark'd with blood those sleepy two
The Tragedy of Macbeth,1,7,MACBETH,5,"Of his own chamber and used their very daggers,"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,1,7,MACBETH,6,That they have done't?
The Tragedy of Macbeth,1,7,LADY MACBETH,1,"Who dares receive it other,"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,1,7,LADY MACBETH,2,As we shall make our griefs and clamour roar
The Tragedy of Macbeth,1,7,LADY MACBETH,3,Upon his death?
The Tragedy of Macbeth,1,7,MACBETH,1,"I am settled, and bend up"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,1,7,MACBETH,2,Each corporal agent to this terrible feat.
The Tragedy of Macbeth,1,7,MACBETH,3,"Away, and mock the time with fairest show:"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,1,7,MACBETH,4,False face must hide what the false heart doth know.
The Tragedy of Macbeth,2,1,BANQUO,1,"How goes the night, boy?"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,2,1,FLEANCE,1,The moon is down; I have not heard the clock.
The Tragedy of Macbeth,2,1,BANQUO,1,And she goes down at twelve.
The Tragedy of Macbeth,2,1,FLEANCE,1,"I take't, 'tis later, sir."
The Tragedy of Macbeth,2,1,BANQUO,1,"Hold, take my sword. There's husbandry in heaven;"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,2,1,BANQUO,2,Their candles are all out. Take thee that too.
The Tragedy of Macbeth,2,1,BANQUO,3,"A heavy summons lies like lead upon me,"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,2,1,BANQUO,4,"And yet I would not sleep: merciful powers,"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,2,1,BANQUO,5,Restrain in me the cursed thoughts that nature
The Tragedy of Macbeth,2,1,BANQUO,6,Gives way to in repose!
The Tragedy of Macbeth,2,1,BANQUO,7,Give me my sword.
The Tragedy of Macbeth,2,1,BANQUO,8,Who's there?
The Tragedy of Macbeth,2,1,MACBETH,1,A friend.
The Tragedy of Macbeth,2,1,BANQUO,1,"What, sir, not yet at rest? The king's a-bed:"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,2,1,BANQUO,2,"He hath been in unusual pleasure, and"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,2,1,BANQUO,3,Sent forth great largess to your offices.
The Tragedy of Macbeth,2,1,BANQUO,4,"This diamond he greets your wife withal,"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,2,1,BANQUO,5,By the name of most kind hostess; and shut up
The Tragedy of Macbeth,2,1,BANQUO,6,In measureless content.
The Tragedy of Macbeth,2,1,MACBETH,1,"Being unprepared,"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,2,1,MACBETH,2,Our will became the servant to defect;
The Tragedy of Macbeth,2,1,MACBETH,3,Which else should free have wrought.
The Tragedy of Macbeth,2,1,BANQUO,1,All's well.
The Tragedy of Macbeth,2,1,BANQUO,2,I dreamt last night of the three weird sisters:
The Tragedy of Macbeth,2,1,BANQUO,3,To you they have show'd some truth.
The Tragedy of Macbeth,2,1,MACBETH,1,I think not of them:
The Tragedy of Macbeth,2,1,MACBETH,2,"Yet, when we can entreat an hour to serve,"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,2,1,MACBETH,3,"We would spend it in some words upon that business,"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,2,1,MACBETH,4,If you would grant the time.
The Tragedy of Macbeth,2,1,BANQUO,1,At your kind'st leisure.
The Tragedy of Macbeth,2,1,MACBETH,1,"If you shall cleave to my consent, when 'tis,"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,2,1,MACBETH,2,It shall make honour for you.
The Tragedy of Macbeth,2,1,BANQUO,1,So I lose none
The Tragedy of Macbeth,2,1,BANQUO,2,"In seeking to augment it, but still keep"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,2,1,BANQUO,3,"My bosom franchised and allegiance clear,"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,2,1,BANQUO,4,I shall be counsell'd.
The Tragedy of Macbeth,2,1,MACBETH,1,Good repose the while!
The Tragedy of Macbeth,2,1,BANQUO,1,"Thanks, sir: the like to you!"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,2,1,MACBETH,1,"Go bid thy mistress, when my drink is ready,"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,2,1,MACBETH,2,She strike upon the bell. Get thee to bed.
The Tragedy of Macbeth,2,1,MACBETH,3,"Is this a dagger which I see before me,"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,2,1,MACBETH,4,"The handle toward my hand? Come, let me clutch thee."
The Tragedy of Macbeth,2,1,MACBETH,5,"I have thee not, and yet I see thee still."
The Tragedy of Macbeth,2,1,MACBETH,6,"Art thou not, fatal vision, sensible"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,2,1,MACBETH,7,To feeling as to sight? or art thou but
The Tragedy of Macbeth,2,1,MACBETH,8,"A dagger of the mind, a false creation,"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,2,1,MACBETH,9,Proceeding from the heat-oppressed brain?
The Tragedy of Macbeth,2,1,MACBETH,10,"I see thee yet, in form as palpable"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,2,1,MACBETH,11,As this which now I draw.
The Tragedy of Macbeth,2,1,MACBETH,12,Thou marshall'st me the way that I was going;
The Tragedy of Macbeth,2,1,MACBETH,13,And such an instrument I was to use.
The Tragedy of Macbeth,2,1,MACBETH,14,"Mine eyes are made the fools o' the other senses,"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,2,1,MACBETH,15,"Or else worth all the rest; I see thee still,"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,2,1,MACBETH,16,"And on thy blade and dudgeon gouts of blood,"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,2,1,MACBETH,17,Which was not so before. There's no such thing:
The Tragedy of Macbeth,2,1,MACBETH,18,It is the bloody business which informs
The Tragedy of Macbeth,2,1,MACBETH,19,Thus to mine eyes. Now o'er the one halfworld
The Tragedy of Macbeth,2,1,MACBETH,20,"Nature seems dead, and wicked dreams abuse"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,2,1,MACBETH,21,The curtain'd sleep; witchcraft celebrates
The Tragedy of Macbeth,2,1,MACBETH,22,"Pale Hecate's offerings, and wither'd murder,"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,2,1,MACBETH,23,"Alarum'd by his sentinel, the wolf,"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,2,1,MACBETH,24,"Whose howl's his watch, thus with his stealthy pace."
The Tragedy of Macbeth,2,1,MACBETH,25,"With Tarquin's ravishing strides, towards his design"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,2,1,MACBETH,26,"Moves like a ghost. Thou sure and firm-set earth,"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,2,1,MACBETH,27,"Hear not my steps, which way they walk, for fear"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,2,1,MACBETH,28,"Thy very stones prate of my whereabout,"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,2,1,MACBETH,29,"And take the present horror from the time,"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,2,1,MACBETH,30,"Which now suits with it. Whiles I threat, he lives:"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,2,1,MACBETH,31,Words to the heat of deeds too cold breath gives.
The Tragedy of Macbeth,2,1,MACBETH,32,"I go, and it is done; the bell invites me."
The Tragedy of Macbeth,2,1,MACBETH,33,"Hear it not, Duncan; for it is a knell"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,2,1,MACBETH,34,That summons thee to heaven or to hell.
The Tragedy of Macbeth,2,2,LADY MACBETH,1,That which hath made them drunk hath made me bold;
The Tragedy of Macbeth,2,2,LADY MACBETH,2,What hath quench'd them hath given me fire.
The Tragedy of Macbeth,2,2,LADY MACBETH,3,Hark! Peace!
The Tragedy of Macbeth,2,2,LADY MACBETH,4,"It was the owl that shriek'd, the fatal bellman,"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,2,2,LADY MACBETH,5,Which gives the stern'st good-night. He is about it:
The Tragedy of Macbeth,2,2,LADY MACBETH,6,The doors are open; and the surfeited grooms
The Tragedy of Macbeth,2,2,LADY MACBETH,7,Do mock their charge with snores: I have drugg'd
The Tragedy of Macbeth,2,2,LADY MACBETH,8,"their possets,"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,2,2,LADY MACBETH,9,"That death and nature do contend about them,"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,2,2,LADY MACBETH,10,Whether they live or die.
The Tragedy of Macbeth,2,2,LADY MACBETH,1,"Alack, I am afraid they have awaked,"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,2,2,LADY MACBETH,2,And 'tis not done. The attempt and not the deed
The Tragedy of Macbeth,2,2,LADY MACBETH,3,Confounds us. Hark! I laid their daggers ready;
The Tragedy of Macbeth,2,2,LADY MACBETH,4,He could not miss 'em. Had he not resembled
The Tragedy of Macbeth,2,2,LADY MACBETH,5,"My father as he slept, I had done't."
The Tragedy of Macbeth,2,2,LADY MACBETH,6,My husband!
The Tragedy of Macbeth,2,2,MACBETH,1,I have done the deed. Didst thou not hear a noise?
The Tragedy of Macbeth,2,2,LADY MACBETH,1,I heard the owl scream and the crickets cry.
The Tragedy of Macbeth,2,2,LADY MACBETH,2,Did not you speak?
The Tragedy of Macbeth,2,2,MACBETH,1,When?
The Tragedy of Macbeth,2,2,LADY MACBETH,1,Now.
The Tragedy of Macbeth,2,2,MACBETH,1,As I descended?
The Tragedy of Macbeth,2,2,LADY MACBETH,1,Ay.
The Tragedy of Macbeth,2,2,MACBETH,1,Hark!
The Tragedy of Macbeth,2,2,MACBETH,2,Who lies i' the second chamber?
The Tragedy of Macbeth,2,2,LADY MACBETH,1,Donalbain.
The Tragedy of Macbeth,2,2,MACBETH,1,This is a sorry sight.
The Tragedy of Macbeth,2,2,LADY MACBETH,1,"A foolish thought, to say a sorry sight."
The Tragedy of Macbeth,2,2,MACBETH,1,"There's one did laugh in's sleep, and one cried"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,2,2,MACBETH,2,'Murder!'
The Tragedy of Macbeth,2,2,MACBETH,3,That they did wake each other: I stood and heard them:
The Tragedy of Macbeth,2,2,MACBETH,4,"But they did say their prayers, and address'd them"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,2,2,MACBETH,5,Again to sleep.
The Tragedy of Macbeth,2,2,LADY MACBETH,1,There are two lodged together.
The Tragedy of Macbeth,2,2,MACBETH,1,One cried 'God bless us!' and 'Amen' the other;
The Tragedy of Macbeth,2,2,MACBETH,2,As they had seen me with these hangman's hands.
The Tragedy of Macbeth,2,2,MACBETH,3,"Listening their fear, I could not say 'Amen,'"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,2,2,MACBETH,4,When they did say 'God bless us!'
The Tragedy of Macbeth,2,2,LADY MACBETH,1,Consider it not so deeply.
The Tragedy of Macbeth,2,2,MACBETH,1,But wherefore could not I pronounce 'Amen'?
The Tragedy of Macbeth,2,2,MACBETH,2,"I had most need of blessing, and 'Amen'"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,2,2,MACBETH,3,Stuck in my throat.
The Tragedy of Macbeth,2,2,LADY MACBETH,1,These deeds must not be thought
The Tragedy of Macbeth,2,2,LADY MACBETH,2,"After these ways; so, it will make us mad."
The Tragedy of Macbeth,2,2,MACBETH,1,Methought I heard a voice cry 'Sleep no more!
The Tragedy of Macbeth,2,2,MACBETH,2,"Macbeth does murder sleep', the innocent sleep,"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,2,2,MACBETH,3,"Sleep that knits up the ravell'd sleeve of care,"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,2,2,MACBETH,4,"The death of each day's life, sore labour's bath,"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,2,2,MACBETH,5,"Balm of hurt minds, great nature's second course,"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,2,2,MACBETH,6,"Chief nourisher in life's feast,--"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,2,2,LADY MACBETH,1,What do you mean?
The Tragedy of Macbeth,2,2,MACBETH,1,Still it cried 'Sleep no more!' to all the house:
The Tragedy of Macbeth,2,2,MACBETH,2,"'Glamis hath murder'd sleep, and therefore Cawdor"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,2,2,MACBETH,3,Shall sleep no more; Macbeth shall sleep no more.'
The Tragedy of Macbeth,2,2,LADY MACBETH,1,"Who was it that thus cried? Why, worthy thane,"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,2,2,LADY MACBETH,2,"You do unbend your noble strength, to think"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,2,2,LADY MACBETH,3,"So brainsickly of things. Go get some water,"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,2,2,LADY MACBETH,4,And wash this filthy witness from your hand.
The Tragedy of Macbeth,2,2,LADY MACBETH,5,Why did you bring these daggers from the place?
The Tragedy of Macbeth,2,2,LADY MACBETH,6,They must lie there: go carry them; and smear
The Tragedy of Macbeth,2,2,LADY MACBETH,7,The sleepy grooms with blood.
The Tragedy of Macbeth,2,2,MACBETH,1,I'll go no more:
The Tragedy of Macbeth,2,2,MACBETH,2,I am afraid to think what I have done;
The Tragedy of Macbeth,2,2,MACBETH,3,Look on't again I dare not.
The Tragedy of Macbeth,2,2,LADY MACBETH,1,Infirm of purpose!
The Tragedy of Macbeth,2,2,LADY MACBETH,2,Give me the daggers: the sleeping and the dead
The Tragedy of Macbeth,2,2,LADY MACBETH,3,Are but as pictures: 'tis the eye of childhood
The Tragedy of Macbeth,2,2,LADY MACBETH,4,"That fears a painted devil. If he do bleed,"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,2,2,LADY MACBETH,5,I'll gild the faces of the grooms withal;
The Tragedy of Macbeth,2,2,LADY MACBETH,6,For it must seem their guilt.
The Tragedy of Macbeth,2,2,MACBETH,1,Whence is that knocking?
The Tragedy of Macbeth,2,2,MACBETH,2,"How is't with me, when every noise appals me?"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,2,2,MACBETH,3,What hands are here? ha! they pluck out mine eyes.
The Tragedy of Macbeth,2,2,MACBETH,4,Will all great Neptune's ocean wash this blood
The Tragedy of Macbeth,2,2,MACBETH,5,"Clean from my hand? No, this my hand will rather"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,2,2,MACBETH,6,"The multitudinous seas in incarnadine,"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,2,2,MACBETH,7,Making the green one red.
The Tragedy of Macbeth,2,2,LADY MACBETH,1,My hands are of your colour; but I shame
The Tragedy of Macbeth,2,2,LADY MACBETH,2,To wear a heart so white.
The Tragedy of Macbeth,2,2,LADY MACBETH,3,I hear a knocking
The Tragedy of Macbeth,2,2,LADY MACBETH,4,At the south entry: retire we to our chamber;
The Tragedy of Macbeth,2,2,LADY MACBETH,5,A little water clears us of this deed:
The Tragedy of Macbeth,2,2,LADY MACBETH,6,"How easy is it, then! Your constancy"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,2,2,LADY MACBETH,7,Hath left you unattended.
The Tragedy of Macbeth,2,2,LADY MACBETH,8,Hark! more knocking.
The Tragedy of Macbeth,2,2,LADY MACBETH,9,"Get on your nightgown, lest occasion call us,"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,2,2,LADY MACBETH,10,And show us to be watchers. Be not lost
The Tragedy of Macbeth,2,2,LADY MACBETH,11,So poorly in your thoughts.
The Tragedy of Macbeth,2,2,MACBETH,1,"To know my deed, 'twere best not know myself."
The Tragedy of Macbeth,2,2,MACBETH,2,Wake Duncan with thy knocking! I would thou couldst!
The Tragedy of Macbeth,2,3,PORTER,1,Here's a knocking indeed! If a
The Tragedy of Macbeth,2,3,PORTER,2,"man were porter of hell-gate, he should have"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,2,3,PORTER,3,old turning the key.
The Tragedy of Macbeth,2,3,PORTER,4,"Knock,"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,2,3,PORTER,5,"knock, knock! Who's there, i' the name of"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,2,3,PORTER,6,"Beelzebub? Here's a farmer, that hanged"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,2,3,PORTER,7,himself on the expectation of plenty: come in
The Tragedy of Macbeth,2,3,PORTER,8,time; have napkins enow about you; here
The Tragedy of Macbeth,2,3,PORTER,9,you'll sweat for't.
The Tragedy of Macbeth,2,3,PORTER,10,"Knock,"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,2,3,PORTER,11,"knock! Who's there, in the other devil's"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,2,3,PORTER,12,"name? Faith, here's an equivocator, that could"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,2,3,PORTER,13,swear in both the scales against either scale;
The Tragedy of Macbeth,2,3,PORTER,14,"who committed treason enough for God's sake,"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,2,3,PORTER,15,"yet could not equivocate to heaven: O, come"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,2,3,PORTER,16,"in, equivocator."
The Tragedy of Macbeth,2,3,PORTER,17,"Knock,"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,2,3,PORTER,18,"knock, knock! Who's there? Faith, here's an"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,2,3,PORTER,19,"English tailor come hither, for stealing out of"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,2,3,PORTER,20,"a French hose: come in, tailor; here you may"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,2,3,PORTER,21,roast your goose.
The Tragedy of Macbeth,2,3,PORTER,22,"Knock,"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,2,3,PORTER,23,knock; never at quiet! What are you? But
The Tragedy of Macbeth,2,3,PORTER,24,this place is too cold for hell. I'll devil-porter
The Tragedy of Macbeth,2,3,PORTER,25,it no further: I had thought to have let in
The Tragedy of Macbeth,2,3,PORTER,26,some of all professions that go the primrose
The Tragedy of Macbeth,2,3,PORTER,27,way to the everlasting bonfire.
The Tragedy of Macbeth,2,3,PORTER,28,"Anon, anon! I pray you, remember the porter."
The Tragedy of Macbeth,2,3,MACDUFF,1,"Was it so late, friend, ere you went to bed,"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,2,3,MACDUFF,2,That you do lie so late?
The Tragedy of Macbeth,2,3,PORTER,1,"'Faith sir, we were carousing till the"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,2,3,PORTER,2,"second cock: and drink, sir, is a great"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,2,3,PORTER,3,provoker of three things.
The Tragedy of Macbeth,2,3,MACDUFF,1,What three things does drink especially provoke?
The Tragedy of Macbeth,2,3,PORTER,1,"Marry, sir, nose-painting, sleep, and"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,2,3,PORTER,2,"urine. Lechery, sir, it provokes, and unprovokes;"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,2,3,PORTER,3,"it provokes the desire, but it takes"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,2,3,PORTER,4,"away the performance: therefore, much drink"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,2,3,PORTER,5,may be said to be an equivocator with lechery:
The Tragedy of Macbeth,2,3,PORTER,6,"it makes him, and it mars him; it sets"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,2,3,PORTER,7,"him on, and it takes him off; it persuades him,"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,2,3,PORTER,8,"and disheartens him; makes him stand to, and"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,2,3,PORTER,9,"not stand to; in conclusion, equivocates him"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,2,3,PORTER,10,"in a sleep, and, giving him the lie, leaves him."
The Tragedy of Macbeth,2,3,MACDUFF,1,I believe drink gave thee the lie last night.
The Tragedy of Macbeth,2,3,PORTER,1,"That it did, sir, i' the very throat on"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,2,3,PORTER,2,"me: but I requited him for his lie; and, I"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,2,3,PORTER,3,"think, being too strong for him, though he took"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,2,3,PORTER,4,"up my legs sometime, yet I made a shift to cast"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,2,3,PORTER,5,him.
The Tragedy of Macbeth,2,3,MACDUFF,1,Is thy master stirring?
The Tragedy of Macbeth,2,3,MACDUFF,2,Our knocking has awaked him; here he comes.
The Tragedy of Macbeth,2,3,LENNOX,1,"Good morrow, noble sir."
The Tragedy of Macbeth,2,3,MACBETH,1,"Good morrow, both."
The Tragedy of Macbeth,2,3,MACDUFF,1,"Is the king stirring, worthy thane?"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,2,3,MACBETH,1,Not yet.
The Tragedy of Macbeth,2,3,MACDUFF,1,He did command me to call timely on him:
The Tragedy of Macbeth,2,3,MACDUFF,2,I have almost slipp'd the hour.
The Tragedy of Macbeth,2,3,MACBETH,1,I'll bring you to him.
The Tragedy of Macbeth,2,3,MACDUFF,1,I know this is a joyful trouble to you;
The Tragedy of Macbeth,2,3,MACDUFF,2,But yet 'tis one.
The Tragedy of Macbeth,2,3,MACBETH,1,The labour we delight in physics pain.
The Tragedy of Macbeth,2,3,MACBETH,2,This is the door.
The Tragedy of Macbeth,2,3,MACDUFF,1,"I'll make so bold to call,"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,2,3,MACDUFF,2,For 'tis my limited service.
The Tragedy of Macbeth,2,3,LENNOX,1,Goes the king hence to-day?
The Tragedy of Macbeth,2,3,MACBETH,1,He does: he did appoint so.
The Tragedy of Macbeth,2,3,LENNOX,1,"The night has been unruly: where we lay,"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,2,3,LENNOX,2,"Our chimneys were blown down; and, as they say,"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,2,3,LENNOX,3,"Lamentings heard i' the air; strange screams of death,"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,2,3,LENNOX,4,And prophesying with accents terrible
The Tragedy of Macbeth,2,3,LENNOX,5,Of dire combustion and confused events
The Tragedy of Macbeth,2,3,LENNOX,6,New hatch'd to the woeful time: the obscure bird
The Tragedy of Macbeth,2,3,LENNOX,7,"Clamour'd the livelong night: some say, the earth"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,2,3,LENNOX,8,Was feverous and did shake.
The Tragedy of Macbeth,2,3,MACBETH,1,'Twas a rough night.
The Tragedy of Macbeth,2,3,LENNOX,1,My young remembrance cannot parallel
The Tragedy of Macbeth,2,3,LENNOX,2,A fellow to it.
The Tragedy of Macbeth,2,3,MACDUFF,1,"O horror, horror, horror! Tongue nor heart"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,2,3,MACDUFF,2,Cannot conceive nor name thee!
The Tragedy of Macbeth,2,3,MACBETH,1,What's the matter.
The Tragedy of Macbeth,2,3,LENNOX,1,What's the matter.
The Tragedy of Macbeth,2,3,MACDUFF,1,Confusion now hath made his masterpiece!
The Tragedy of Macbeth,2,3,MACDUFF,2,Most sacrilegious murder hath broke ope
The Tragedy of Macbeth,2,3,MACDUFF,3,"The Lord's anointed temple, and stole thence"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,2,3,MACDUFF,4,The life o' the building!
The Tragedy of Macbeth,2,3,MACBETH,1,What is 't you say? the life?
The Tragedy of Macbeth,2,3,LENNOX,1,Mean you his majesty?
The Tragedy of Macbeth,2,3,MACDUFF,1,"Approach the chamber, and destroy your sight"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,2,3,MACDUFF,2,With a new Gorgon: do not bid me speak;
The Tragedy of Macbeth,2,3,MACDUFF,3,"See, and then speak yourselves."
The Tragedy of Macbeth,2,3,MACDUFF,4,"Awake, awake!"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,2,3,MACDUFF,5,Ring the alarum-bell. Murder and treason!
The Tragedy of Macbeth,2,3,MACDUFF,6,Banquo and Donalbain! Malcolm! awake!
The Tragedy of Macbeth,2,3,MACDUFF,7,"Shake off this downy sleep, death's counterfeit,"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,2,3,MACDUFF,8,"And look on death itself! up, up, and see"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,2,3,MACDUFF,9,The great doom's image! Malcolm! Banquo!
The Tragedy of Macbeth,2,3,MACDUFF,10,"As from your graves rise up, and walk like sprites,"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,2,3,MACDUFF,11,To countenance this horror! Ring the bell.
The Tragedy of Macbeth,2,3,LADY MACBETH,1,"What's the business,"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,2,3,LADY MACBETH,2,That such a hideous trumpet calls to parley
The Tragedy of Macbeth,2,3,LADY MACBETH,3,"The sleepers of the house? speak, speak!"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,2,3,MACDUFF,1,"O gentle lady,"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,2,3,MACDUFF,2,'Tis not for you to hear what I can speak:
The Tragedy of Macbeth,2,3,MACDUFF,3,"The repetition, in a woman's ear,"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,2,3,MACDUFF,4,Would murder as it fell.
The Tragedy of Macbeth,2,3,MACDUFF,5,"O Banquo, Banquo,"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,2,3,MACDUFF,6,Our royal master 's murder'd!
The Tragedy of Macbeth,2,3,LADY MACBETH,1,"Woe, alas!"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,2,3,LADY MACBETH,2,"What, in our house?"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,2,3,BANQUO,1,Too cruel any where.
The Tragedy of Macbeth,2,3,BANQUO,2,"Dear Duff, I prithee, contradict thyself,"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,2,3,BANQUO,3,And say it is not so.
The Tragedy of Macbeth,2,3,MACBETH,1,"Had I but died an hour before this chance,"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,2,3,MACBETH,2,"I had lived a blessed time; for, from this instant,"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,2,3,MACBETH,3,There 's nothing serious in mortality:
The Tragedy of Macbeth,2,3,MACBETH,4,All is but toys: renown and grace is dead;
The Tragedy of Macbeth,2,3,MACBETH,5,"The wine of life is drawn, and the mere lees"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,2,3,MACBETH,6,Is left this vault to brag of.
The Tragedy of Macbeth,2,3,DONALBAIN,1,What is amiss?
The Tragedy of Macbeth,2,3,MACBETH,1,"You are, and do not know't:"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,2,3,MACBETH,2,"The spring, the head, the fountain of your blood"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,2,3,MACBETH,3,Is stopp'd; the very source of it is stopp'd.
The Tragedy of Macbeth,2,3,MACDUFF,1,Your royal father 's murder'd.
The Tragedy of Macbeth,2,3,MALCOLM,1,"O, by whom?"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,2,3,LENNOX,1,"Those of his chamber, as it seem'd, had done 't:"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,2,3,LENNOX,2,Their hands and faces were an badged with blood;
The Tragedy of Macbeth,2,3,LENNOX,3,"So were their daggers, which unwiped we found"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,2,3,LENNOX,4,Upon their pillows:
The Tragedy of Macbeth,2,3,LENNOX,5,"They stared, and were distracted; no man's life"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,2,3,LENNOX,6,Was to be trusted with them.
The Tragedy of Macbeth,2,3,MACBETH,1,"O, yet I do repent me of my fury,"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,2,3,MACBETH,2,That I did kill them.
The Tragedy of Macbeth,2,3,MACDUFF,1,Wherefore did you so?
The Tragedy of Macbeth,2,3,MACBETH,1,"Who can be wise, amazed, temperate and furious,"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,2,3,MACBETH,2,"Loyal and neutral, in a moment? No man:"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,2,3,MACBETH,3,The expedition my violent love
The Tragedy of Macbeth,2,3,MACBETH,4,"Outrun the pauser, reason. Here lay Duncan,"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,2,3,MACBETH,5,His silver skin laced with his golden blood;
The Tragedy of Macbeth,2,3,MACBETH,6,And his gash'd stabs look'd like a breach in nature
The Tragedy of Macbeth,2,3,MACBETH,7,"For ruin's wasteful entrance: there, the murderers,"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,2,3,MACBETH,8,"Steep'd in the colours of their trade, their daggers"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,2,3,MACBETH,9,"Unmannerly breech'd with gore: who could refrain,"

The Tragedy of Macbeth,2,3,MACBETH,11,Courage to make 's love known?
The Tragedy of Macbeth,2,3,LADY MACBETH,1,"Help me hence, ho!"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,2,3,MACDUFF,1,Look to the lady.
The Tragedy of Macbeth,2,3,MALCOLM,1,That most may claim this argument for ours?
The Tragedy of Macbeth,2,3,DONALBAIN,1,"where our fate,"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,2,3,DONALBAIN,2,"Hid in an auger-hole, may rush, and seize us?"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,2,3,DONALBAIN,3,Let 's away;
The Tragedy of Macbeth,2,3,DONALBAIN,4,Our tears are not yet brew'd.
The Tragedy of Macbeth,2,3,MALCOLM,1,Upon the foot of motion.
The Tragedy of Macbeth,2,3,BANQUO,1,Look to the lady:

The Tragedy of Macbeth,2,3,BANQUO,3,"That suffer in exposure, let us meet,"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,2,3,BANQUO,4,"And question this most bloody piece of work,"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,2,3,BANQUO,5,To know it further. Fears and scruples shake us:
The Tragedy of Macbeth,2,3,BANQUO,6,In the great hand of God I stand; and thence
The Tragedy of Macbeth,2,3,BANQUO,7,Against the undivulged pretence I fight
The Tragedy of Macbeth,2,3,BANQUO,8,Of treasonous malice.
The Tragedy of Macbeth,2,3,MACDUFF,1,And so do I.
The Tragedy of Macbeth,2,3,ALL,1,So all.
The Tragedy of Macbeth,2,3,MACBETH,1,"Let's briefly put on manly readiness,"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,2,3,MACBETH,2,And meet i' the hall together.
The Tragedy of Macbeth,2,3,ALL,1,Well contented.
The Tragedy of Macbeth,2,3,MALCOLM,1,What will you do? Let's not consort with them:
The Tragedy of Macbeth,2,3,MALCOLM,2,To show an unfelt sorrow is an office
The Tragedy of Macbeth,2,3,MALCOLM,3,Which the false man does easy. I'll to England.
The Tragedy of Macbeth,2,3,DONALBAIN,1,"To Ireland, I; our separated fortune"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,2,3,DONALBAIN,2,"Shall keep us both the safer: where we are,"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,2,3,DONALBAIN,3,"There's daggers in men's smiles: the near in blood,"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,2,3,DONALBAIN,4,The nearer bloody.
The Tragedy of Macbeth,2,3,MALCOLM,1,This murderous shaft that's shot

The Tragedy of Macbeth,2,4,ROSS,1,"Alas, the day!"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,2,4,ROSS,2,What good could they pretend?

The Tragedy of Macbeth,3,1,MACBETH,3,In this day's council; but we'll take to-morrow.
The Tragedy of Macbeth,3,1,MACBETH,4,Is't far you ride?

The Tragedy of Macbeth,3,1,MACBETH,1,Bring them before us.
The Tragedy of Macbeth,3,1,MACBETH,2,To be thus is nothing;
The Tragedy of Macbeth,3,1,MACBETH,3,But to be safely thus.--Our fears in Banquo
The Tragedy of Macbeth,3,1,MACBETH,4,Stick deep; and in his royalty of nature
The Tragedy of Macbeth,3,1,MACBETH,5,Reigns that which would be fear'd: 'tis much he dares;
The Tragedy of Macbeth,3,1,MACBETH,6,"And, to that dauntless temper of his mind,"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,3,1,MACBETH,7,He hath a wisdom that doth guide his valour
The Tragedy of Macbeth,3,1,MACBETH,8,To act in safety. There is none but he

The Tragedy of Macbeth,3,1,MACBETH,13,And bade them speak to him: then prophet-like
The Tragedy of Macbeth,3,1,MACBETH,14,They hail'd him father to a line of kings:
The Tragedy of Macbeth,3,1,MACBETH,15,"Upon my head they placed a fruitless crown,"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,3,1,MACBETH,16,"And put a barren sceptre in my gripe,"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,3,1,MACBETH,17,"Thence to be wrench'd with an unlineal hand,"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,3,1,MACBETH,18,"No son of mine succeeding. If 't be so,"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,3,1,MACBETH,19,For Banquo's issue have I filed my mind;
The Tragedy of Macbeth,3,1,MACBETH,20,For them the gracious Duncan have I murder'd;
The Tragedy of Macbeth,3,1,MACBETH,21,Put rancours in the vessel of my peace
The Tragedy of Macbeth,3,1,MACBETH,22,Only for them; and mine eternal jewel
The Tragedy of Macbeth,3,1,MACBETH,23,"Given to the common enemy of man,"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,3,1,MACBETH,24,"To make them kings, the seed of Banquo kings!"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,3,1,MACBETH,25,"Rather than so, come fate into the list."
The Tragedy of Macbeth,3,1,MACBETH,26,And champion me to the utterance! Who's there!
The Tragedy of Macbeth,3,1,MACBETH,27,"Now go to the door, and stay there till we call."
The Tragedy of Macbeth,3,1,MACBETH,28,Was it not yesterday we spoke together?
The Tragedy of Macbeth,3,1,FIRST MURDERER,1,"It was, so please your highness."
The Tragedy of Macbeth,3,1,MACBETH,1,"Well then, now"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,3,1,MACBETH,2,Have you consider'd of my speeches? Know

The Tragedy of Macbeth,3,1,MACBETH,4,"So under fortune, which you thought had been"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,3,1,MACBETH,5,Our innocent self: this I made good to you
The Tragedy of Macbeth,3,1,MACBETH,6,"In our last conference, pass'd in probation with you,"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,3,1,MACBETH,7,"How you were borne in hand, how cross'd,"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,3,1,MACBETH,8,"the instruments,"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,3,1,MACBETH,9,"Who wrought with them, and all things else that might"

The Tragedy of Macbeth,3,1,MACBETH,1,"I did so, and went further, which is now"

The Tragedy of Macbeth,3,1,MACBETH,3,Your patience so predominant in your nature
The Tragedy of Macbeth,3,1,MACBETH,4,That you can let this go? Are you so gospell'd
The Tragedy of Macbeth,3,1,MACBETH,5,"To pray for this good man and for his issue,"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,3,1,MACBETH,6,Whose heavy hand hath bow'd you to the grave
The Tragedy of Macbeth,3,1,MACBETH,7,And beggar'd yours for ever?
The Tragedy of Macbeth,3,1,FIRST MURDERER,1,"We are men, my liege."
The Tragedy of Macbeth,3,1,MACBETH,1,"Ay, in the catalogue ye go for men;"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,3,1,MACBETH,2,"As hounds and greyhounds, mongrels, spaniels, curs,"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,3,1,MACBETH,3,"Shoughs, water-rugs and demi-wolves, are clept"

The Tragedy of Macbeth,3,1,MACBETH,6,"The housekeeper, the hunter, every one"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,3,1,MACBETH,7,According to the gift which bounteous nature
The Tragedy of Macbeth,3,1,MACBETH,8,Hath in him closed; whereby he does receive
The Tragedy of Macbeth,3,1,MACBETH,9,Particular addition. from the bill
The Tragedy of Macbeth,3,1,MACBETH,10,That writes them all alike: and so of men.
The Tragedy of Macbeth,3,1,MACBETH,11,"Now, if you have a station in the file,"

The Tragedy of Macbeth,3,1,MACBETH,1,Both of you
The Tragedy of Macbeth,3,1,MACBETH,2,Know Banquo was your enemy.
The Tragedy of Macbeth,3,1,BOTH MURDERERS,1,"True, my lord."
The Tragedy of Macbeth,3,1,MACBETH,1,"So is he mine; and in such bloody distance,"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,3,1,MACBETH,2,That every minute of his being thrusts
The Tragedy of Macbeth,3,1,MACBETH,3,Against my near'st of life: and though I could
The Tragedy of Macbeth,3,1,MACBETH,4,With barefaced power sweep him from my sight
The Tragedy of Macbeth,3,1,MACBETH,5,"And bid my will avouch it, yet I must not,"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,3,1,MACBETH,6,"For certain friends that are both his and mine,"

The Tragedy of Macbeth,3,1,MACBETH,11,For sundry weighty reasons.
The Tragedy of Macbeth,3,1,SECOND MURDERER,1,"We shall, my lord,"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,3,1,SECOND MURDERER,2,Perform what you command us.
The Tragedy of Macbeth,3,1,FIRST MURDERER,1,Though our lives--
The Tragedy of Macbeth,3,1,MACBETH,1,Your spirits shine through you. Within this hour at most
The Tragedy of Macbeth,3,1,MACBETH,2,I will advise you where to plant yourselves;
The Tragedy of Macbeth,3,1,MACBETH,3,"Acquaint you with the perfect spy o' the time,"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,3,1,MACBETH,4,"The moment on't; for't must be done to-night,"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,3,1,MACBETH,5,And something from the palace; always thought
The Tragedy of Macbeth,3,1,MACBETH,6,That I require a clearness: and with him--

The Tragedy of Macbeth,3,1,MACBETH,8,"Fleance his son, that keeps him company,"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,3,1,MACBETH,9,Whose absence is no less material to me
The Tragedy of Macbeth,3,1,MACBETH,10,"Than is his father's, must embrace the fate"

The Tragedy of Macbeth,3,1,MACBETH,12,I'll come to you anon.
The Tragedy of Macbeth,3,1,BOTH MURDERERS,1,"We are resolved, my lord."
The Tragedy of Macbeth,3,1,MACBETH,1,I'll call upon you straight: abide within.
The Tragedy of Macbeth,3,1,MACBETH,2,"It is concluded. Banquo, thy soul's flight,"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,3,1,MACBETH,3,"If it find heaven, must find it out to-night."
The Tragedy of Macbeth,3,2,LADY MACBETH,1,Is Banquo gone from court?
The Tragedy of Macbeth,3,2,SERVANT,1,"Ay, madam, but returns again to-night."
The Tragedy of Macbeth,3,2,LADY MACBETH,1,"Say to the king, I would attend his leisure"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,3,2,LADY MACBETH,2,For a few words.
The Tragedy of Macbeth,3,2,SERVANT,1,"Madam, I will."
The Tragedy of Macbeth,3,2,LADY MACBETH,1,"Nought's had, all's spent,"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,3,2,LADY MACBETH,2,Where our desire is got without content:
The Tragedy of Macbeth,3,2,LADY MACBETH,3,'Tis safer to be that which we destroy

The Tragedy of Macbeth,3,2,LADY MACBETH,5,"How now, my lord! why do you keep alone,"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,3,2,LADY MACBETH,6,"Of sorriest fancies your companions making,"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,3,2,LADY MACBETH,7,Using those thoughts which should indeed have died
The Tragedy of Macbeth,3,2,LADY MACBETH,8,With them they think on? Things without all remedy
The Tragedy of Macbeth,3,2,LADY MACBETH,9,Should be without regard: what's done is done.
The Tragedy of Macbeth,3,2,MACBETH,1,"We have scotch'd the snake, not kill'd it:"

The Tragedy of Macbeth,3,2,MACBETH,6,Ere we will eat our meal in fear and sleep
The Tragedy of Macbeth,3,2,MACBETH,7,In the affliction of these terrible dreams
The Tragedy of Macbeth,3,2,MACBETH,8,"That shake us nightly: better be with the dead,"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,3,2,MACBETH,9,"Whom we, to gain our peace, have sent to peace,"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,3,2,MACBETH,10,Than on the torture of the mind to lie
The Tragedy of Macbeth,3,2,MACBETH,11,In restless ecstasy. Duncan is in his grave;
The Tragedy of Macbeth,3,2,MACBETH,12,After life's fitful fever he sleeps well;
The Tragedy of Macbeth,3,2,MACBETH,13,"Treason has done his worst: nor steel, nor poison,"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,3,2,MACBETH,14,"Malice domestic, foreign levy, nothing,"

The Tragedy of Macbeth,3,2,LADY MACBETH,1,Come on;
The Tragedy of Macbeth,3,2,LADY MACBETH,2,"Gentle my lord, sleek o'er your rugged looks;"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,3,2,LADY MACBETH,3,Be bright and jovial among your guests to-night.
The Tragedy of Macbeth,3,2,MACBETH,1,"So shall I, love; and so, I pray, be you:"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,3,2,MACBETH,2,Let your remembrance apply to Banquo;
The Tragedy of Macbeth,3,2,MACBETH,3,"Present him eminence, both with eye and tongue:"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,3,2,MACBETH,4,"Unsafe the while, that we"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,3,2,MACBETH,5,"Must lave our honours in these flattering streams,"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,3,2,MACBETH,6,"And make our faces vizards to our hearts,"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,3,2,MACBETH,7,Disguising what they are.
The Tragedy of Macbeth,3,2,LADY MACBETH,1,You must leave this.
The Tragedy of Macbeth,3,2,MACBETH,1,"O, full of scorpions is my mind, dear wife!"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,3,2,MACBETH,2,"Thou know'st that Banquo, and his Fleance, lives."
The Tragedy of Macbeth,3,2,LADY MACBETH,1,But in them nature's copy's not eterne.
The Tragedy of Macbeth,3,2,MACBETH,1,There's comfort yet; they are assailable;
The Tragedy of Macbeth,3,2,MACBETH,2,Then be thou jocund: ere the bat hath flown
The Tragedy of Macbeth,3,2,MACBETH,3,"His cloister'd flight, ere to black Hecate's summons"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,3,2,MACBETH,4,The shard-borne beetle with his drowsy hums
The Tragedy of Macbeth,3,2,MACBETH,5,"Hath rung night's yawning peal, there shall be done"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,3,2,MACBETH,6,A deed of dreadful note.
The Tragedy of Macbeth,3,2,LADY MACBETH,1,What's to be done?
The Tragedy of Macbeth,3,2,MACBETH,1,"Be innocent of the knowledge, dearest chuck,"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,3,2,MACBETH,2,"Till thou applaud the deed. Come, seeling night,"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,3,2,MACBETH,3,Scarf up the tender eye of pitiful day;
The Tragedy of Macbeth,3,2,MACBETH,4,And with thy bloody and invisible hand
The Tragedy of Macbeth,3,2,MACBETH,5,Cancel and tear to pieces that great bond
The Tragedy of Macbeth,3,2,MACBETH,6,Which keeps me pale! Light thickens; and the crow
The Tragedy of Macbeth,3,2,MACBETH,7,Makes wing to the rooky wood:
The Tragedy of Macbeth,3,2,MACBETH,8,Good things of day begin to droop and drowse;
The Tragedy of Macbeth,3,2,MACBETH,9,While night's black agents to their preys do rouse.
The Tragedy of Macbeth,3,2,MACBETH,10,Thou marvell'st at my words: but hold thee still;
The Tragedy of Macbeth,3,2,MACBETH,11,Things bad begun make strong themselves by ill.
The Tragedy of Macbeth,3,2,MACBETH,12,"So, prithee, go with me."
The Tragedy of Macbeth,3,3,FIRST MURDERER,1,But who did bid thee join with us?
The Tragedy of Macbeth,3,3,THIRD MURDERER,1,Macbeth.
The Tragedy of Macbeth,3,3,SECOND MURDERER,1,"He needs not our mistrust, since he delivers"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,3,3,SECOND MURDERER,2,Our offices and what we have to do
The Tragedy of Macbeth,3,3,SECOND MURDERER,3,To the direction just.
The Tragedy of Macbeth,3,3,FIRST MURDERER,1,Then stand with us.
The Tragedy of Macbeth,3,3,FIRST MURDERER,2,The west yet glimmers with some streaks of day:
The Tragedy of Macbeth,3,3,FIRST MURDERER,3,Now spurs the lated traveller apace
The Tragedy of Macbeth,3,3,FIRST MURDERER,4,To gain the timely inn; and near approaches
The Tragedy of Macbeth,3,3,FIRST MURDERER,5,The subject of our watch.
The Tragedy of Macbeth,3,3,THIRD MURDERER,1,Hark! I hear horses.
The Tragedy of Macbeth,3,3,SECOND MURDERER,1,Then 'tis he: the rest
The Tragedy of Macbeth,3,3,SECOND MURDERER,2,That are within the note of expectation
The Tragedy of Macbeth,3,3,SECOND MURDERER,3,Already are i' the court.
The Tragedy of Macbeth,3,3,FIRST MURDERER,1,His horses go about.
The Tragedy of Macbeth,3,3,THIRD MURDERER,1,"Almost a mile: but he does usually,"

The Tragedy of Macbeth,3,3,SECOND MURDERER,1,"A light, a light!"

The Tragedy of Macbeth,3,3,BANQUO,1,It will be rain to-night.
The Tragedy of Macbeth,3,3,FIRST MURDERER,1,Let it come down.
The Tragedy of Macbeth,3,3,BANQUO,1,"O, treachery! Fly, good Fleance, fly, fly, fly!"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,3,3,BANQUO,2,Thou mayst revenge. O slave!
The Tragedy of Macbeth,3,3,THIRD MURDERER,1,Who did strike out the light?
The Tragedy of Macbeth,3,3,FIRST MURDERER,1,Wast not the way?
The Tragedy of Macbeth,3,3,THIRD MURDERER,1,There's but one down; the son is fled.
The Tragedy of Macbeth,3,3,SECOND MURDERER,1,We have lost
The Tragedy of Macbeth,3,3,SECOND MURDERER,2,Best half of our affair.
The Tragedy of Macbeth,3,3,FIRST MURDERER,1,"Well, let's away, and say how much is done."
The Tragedy of Macbeth,3,4,MACBETH,1,You know your own degrees; sit down: at first
The Tragedy of Macbeth,3,4,MACBETH,2,And last the hearty welcome.
The Tragedy of Macbeth,3,4,LORDS,1,Thanks to your majesty.
The Tragedy of Macbeth,3,4,MACBETH,1,"Ourself will mingle with society,"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,3,4,MACBETH,2,And play the humble host.
The Tragedy of Macbeth,3,4,MACBETH,3,"Our hostess keeps her state, but in best time"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,3,4,MACBETH,4,We will require her welcome.
The Tragedy of Macbeth,3,4,LADY MACBETH,1,"Pronounce it for me, sir, to all our friends;"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,3,4,LADY MACBETH,2,For my heart speaks they are welcome.
The Tragedy of Macbeth,3,4,MACBETH,1,"See, they encounter thee with their hearts' thanks."
The Tragedy of Macbeth,3,4,MACBETH,2,Both sides are even: here I'll sit i' the midst:
The Tragedy of Macbeth,3,4,MACBETH,3,Be large in mirth; anon we'll drink a measure
The Tragedy of Macbeth,3,4,MACBETH,4,The table round.
The Tragedy of Macbeth,3,4,MACBETH,5,There's blood on thy face.
The Tragedy of Macbeth,3,4,FIRST MURDERER,1,'Tis Banquo's then.
The Tragedy of Macbeth,3,4,MACBETH,1,'Tis better thee without than he within.
The Tragedy of Macbeth,3,4,MACBETH,2,Is he dispatch'd?

The Tragedy of Macbeth,3,4,MACBETH,2,"That did the like for Fleance: if thou didst it,"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,3,4,MACBETH,3,Thou art the nonpareil.
The Tragedy of Macbeth,3,4,FIRST MURDERER,1,"Most royal sir,"

The Tragedy of Macbeth,3,4,MACBETH,1,"Then comes my fit again: I had else been perfect,"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,3,4,MACBETH,2,"Whole as the marble, founded as the rock,"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,3,4,MACBETH,3,As broad and general as the casing air:
The Tragedy of Macbeth,3,4,MACBETH,4,"But now I am cabin'd, cribb'd, confined, bound in"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,3,4,MACBETH,5,To saucy doubts and fears. But Banquo's safe?
The Tragedy of Macbeth,3,4,FIRST MURDERER,1,"Ay, my good lord: safe in a ditch he bides,"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,3,4,FIRST MURDERER,2,With twenty trenched gashes on his head;
The Tragedy of Macbeth,3,4,FIRST MURDERER,3,The least a death to nature.
The Tragedy of Macbeth,3,4,MACBETH,1,Thanks for that:
The Tragedy of Macbeth,3,4,MACBETH,2,There the grown serpent lies; the worm that's fled
The Tragedy of Macbeth,3,4,MACBETH,3,"Hath nature that in time will venom breed,"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,3,4,MACBETH,4,No teeth for the present. Get thee gone: to-morrow
The Tragedy of Macbeth,3,4,MACBETH,5,"We'll hear, ourselves, again."
The Tragedy of Macbeth,3,4,LADY MACBETH,1,"My royal lord,"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,3,4,LADY MACBETH,2,You do not give the cheer: the feast is sold
The Tragedy of Macbeth,3,4,LADY MACBETH,3,"That is not often vouch'd, while 'tis a-making,"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,3,4,LADY MACBETH,4,'Tis given with welcome: to feed were best at home;
The Tragedy of Macbeth,3,4,LADY MACBETH,5,From thence the sauce to meat is ceremony;
The Tragedy of Macbeth,3,4,LADY MACBETH,6,Meeting were bare without it.
The Tragedy of Macbeth,3,4,MACBETH,1,Sweet remembrancer!
The Tragedy of Macbeth,3,4,MACBETH,2,"Now, good digestion wait on appetite,"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,3,4,MACBETH,3,And health on both!
The Tragedy of Macbeth,3,4,LENNOX,1,May't please your highness sit.
The Tragedy of Macbeth,3,4,MACBETH,1,"Here had we now our country's honour roof'd,"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,3,4,MACBETH,2,Were the graced person of our Banquo present;
The Tragedy of Macbeth,3,4,MACBETH,3,Who may I rather challenge for unkindness
The Tragedy of Macbeth,3,4,MACBETH,4,Than pity for mischance!
The Tragedy of Macbeth,3,4,ROSS,1,"His absence, sir,"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,3,4,ROSS,2,Lays blame upon his promise. Please't your highness
The Tragedy of Macbeth,3,4,ROSS,3,To grace us with your royal company.
The Tragedy of Macbeth,3,4,MACBETH,1,The table's full.
The Tragedy of Macbeth,3,4,LENNOX,1,"Here is a place reserved, sir."
The Tragedy of Macbeth,3,4,MACBETH,1,Where?
The Tragedy of Macbeth,3,4,LENNOX,1,"Here, my good lord. What is't that moves your highness?"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,3,4,MACBETH,1,Which of you have done this?
The Tragedy of Macbeth,3,4,LORDS,1,"What, my good lord?"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,3,4,MACBETH,1,Thou canst not say I did it: never shake
The Tragedy of Macbeth,3,4,MACBETH,2,Thy gory locks at me.
The Tragedy of Macbeth,3,4,ROSS,1,"Gentlemen, rise: his highness is not well."
The Tragedy of Macbeth,3,4,LADY MACBETH,1,"Sit, worthy friends: my lord is often thus,"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,3,4,LADY MACBETH,2,"And hath been from his youth: pray you, keep seat;"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,3,4,LADY MACBETH,3,The fit is momentary; upon a thought
The Tragedy of Macbeth,3,4,LADY MACBETH,4,"He will again be well: if much you note him,"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,3,4,LADY MACBETH,5,You shall offend him and extend his passion:
The Tragedy of Macbeth,3,4,LADY MACBETH,6,"Feed, and regard him not. Are you a man?"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,3,4,MACBETH,1,"Ay, and a bold one, that dare look on that"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,3,4,MACBETH,2,Which might appal the devil.
The Tragedy of Macbeth,3,4,LADY MACBETH,1,O proper stuff!
The Tragedy of Macbeth,3,4,LADY MACBETH,2,This is the very painting of your fear:
The Tragedy of Macbeth,3,4,LADY MACBETH,3,"This is the air-drawn dagger which, you said,"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,3,4,LADY MACBETH,4,"Led you to Duncan. O, these flaws and starts,"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,3,4,LADY MACBETH,5,"Impostors to true fear, would well become"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,3,4,LADY MACBETH,6,"A woman's story at a winter's fire,"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,3,4,LADY MACBETH,7,Authorized by her grandam. Shame itself!
The Tragedy of Macbeth,3,4,LADY MACBETH,8,"Why do you make such faces? When all's done,"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,3,4,LADY MACBETH,9,You look but on a stool.
The Tragedy of Macbeth,3,4,MACBETH,1,"Prithee, see there! behold! look! lo!"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,3,4,MACBETH,2,how say you?
The Tragedy of Macbeth,3,4,MACBETH,3,"Why, what care I? If thou canst nod, speak too."

The Tragedy of Macbeth,4,1,FIRST WITCH,6,While you perform your antic round:
The Tragedy of Macbeth,4,1,FIRST WITCH,7,"That this great king may kindly say,"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,4,1,FIRST WITCH,8,Our duties did his welcome pay.
The Tragedy of Macbeth,4,1,MACBETH,1,Where are they? Gone? Let this pernicious hour
The Tragedy of Macbeth,4,1,MACBETH,2,Stand aye accursed in the calendar!
The Tragedy of Macbeth,4,1,MACBETH,3,"Come in, without there!"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,4,1,LENNOX,1,What's your grace's will?
The Tragedy of Macbeth,4,1,MACBETH,1,Saw you the weird sisters?
The Tragedy of Macbeth,4,1,LENNOX,1,"No, my lord."
The Tragedy of Macbeth,4,1,MACBETH,1,Came they not by you?
The Tragedy of Macbeth,4,1,LENNOX,1,"No, indeed, my lord."
The Tragedy of Macbeth,4,1,MACBETH,1,Infected be the air whereon they ride;
The Tragedy of Macbeth,4,1,MACBETH,2,And damn'd all those that trust them! I did hear
The Tragedy of Macbeth,4,1,MACBETH,3,The galloping of horse: who was't came by?
The Tragedy of Macbeth,4,1,LENNOX,1,"'Tis two or three, my lord, that bring you word"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,4,1,LENNOX,2,Macduff is fled to England.
The Tragedy of Macbeth,4,1,MACBETH,1,Fled to England!
The Tragedy of Macbeth,4,1,LENNOX,1,"Ay, my good lord."
The Tragedy of Macbeth,4,1,MACBETH,1,"Time, thou anticipatest my dread exploits:"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,4,1,MACBETH,2,The flighty purpose never is o'ertook
The Tragedy of Macbeth,4,1,MACBETH,3,Unless the deed go with it; from this moment
The Tragedy of Macbeth,4,1,MACBETH,4,The very firstlings of my heart shall be
The Tragedy of Macbeth,4,1,MACBETH,5,"The firstlings of my hand. And even now,"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,4,1,MACBETH,6,"To crown my thoughts with acts, be it thought and done:"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,4,1,MACBETH,7,The castle of Macduff I will surprise;
The Tragedy of Macbeth,4,1,MACBETH,8,Seize upon Fife; give to the edge o' the sword
The Tragedy of Macbeth,4,1,MACBETH,9,"His wife, his babes, and all unfortunate souls"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,4,1,MACBETH,10,That trace him in his line. No boasting like a fool;
The Tragedy of Macbeth,4,1,MACBETH,11,This deed I'll do before this purpose cool.
The Tragedy of Macbeth,4,1,MACBETH,12,But no more sights!--Where are these gentlemen?
The Tragedy of Macbeth,4,1,MACBETH,13,"Come, bring me where they are."
The Tragedy of Macbeth,4,2,LADY MACDUFF,1,"What had he done, to make him fly the land?"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,4,2,ROSS,1,"You must have patience, madam."
The Tragedy of Macbeth,4,2,LADY MACDUFF,1,He had none:
The Tragedy of Macbeth,4,2,LADY MACDUFF,2,"His flight was madness: when our actions do not,"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,4,2,LADY MACDUFF,3,Our fears do make us traitors.
The Tragedy of Macbeth,4,2,ROSS,1,You know not
The Tragedy of Macbeth,4,2,ROSS,2,Whether it was his wisdom or his fear.
The Tragedy of Macbeth,4,2,LADY MACDUFF,1,"Wisdom! to leave his wife, to leave his babes,"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,4,2,LADY MACDUFF,2,His mansion and his titles in a place
The Tragedy of Macbeth,4,2,LADY MACDUFF,3,From whence himself does fly? He loves us not;
The Tragedy of Macbeth,4,2,LADY MACDUFF,4,"He wants the natural touch: for the poor wren,"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,4,2,LADY MACDUFF,5,"The most diminutive of birds, will fight,"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,4,2,LADY MACDUFF,6,"Her young ones in her nest, against the owl."
The Tragedy of Macbeth,4,2,LADY MACDUFF,7,All is the fear and nothing is the love;
The Tragedy of Macbeth,4,2,LADY MACDUFF,8,"As little is the wisdom, where the flight"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,4,2,LADY MACDUFF,9,So runs against all reason.
The Tragedy of Macbeth,4,2,ROSS,1,"My dearest coz,"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,4,2,ROSS,2,"I pray you, school yourself: but for your husband,"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,4,2,ROSS,3,"He is noble, wise, judicious, and best knows"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,4,2,ROSS,4,The fits o' the season. I dare not speak
The Tragedy of Macbeth,4,2,ROSS,5,much further;
The Tragedy of Macbeth,4,2,ROSS,6,"But cruel are the times, when we are traitors"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,4,2,ROSS,7,"And do not know ourselves, when we hold rumour"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,4,2,ROSS,8,"From what we fear, yet know not what we fear,"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,4,2,ROSS,9,But float upon a wild and violent sea
The Tragedy of Macbeth,4,2,ROSS,10,Each way and move. I take my leave of you:
The Tragedy of Macbeth,4,2,ROSS,11,Shall not be long but I'll be here again:
The Tragedy of Macbeth,4,2,ROSS,12,"Things at the worst will cease, or else climb upward"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,4,2,ROSS,13,"To what they were before. My pretty cousin,"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,4,2,ROSS,14,Blessing upon you!
The Tragedy of Macbeth,4,2,LADY MACDUFF,1,"Father'd he is, and yet he's fatherless."
The Tragedy of Macbeth,4,2,ROSS,1,"I am so much a fool, should I stay longer,"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,4,2,ROSS,2,It would be my disgrace and your discomfort:
The Tragedy of Macbeth,4,2,ROSS,3,I take my leave at once.
The Tragedy of Macbeth,4,2,LADY MACDUFF,1,"Sirrah, your father's dead;"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,4,2,LADY MACDUFF,2,And what will you do now? How will you live?
The Tragedy of Macbeth,4,2,SON,1,"As birds do, mother."
The Tragedy of Macbeth,4,2,LADY MACDUFF,1,"What, with worms and flies?"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,4,2,SON,1,"With what I get, I mean; and so do they."
The Tragedy of Macbeth,4,2,LADY MACDUFF,1,"Poor bird! thou'ldst never fear the net nor lime,"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,4,2,LADY MACDUFF,2,The pitfall nor the gin.
The Tragedy of Macbeth,4,2,SON,1,"Why should I, mother? Poor birds they are not set for."
The Tragedy of Macbeth,4,2,SON,2,"My father is not dead, for all your saying."
The Tragedy of Macbeth,4,2,LADY MACDUFF,1,"Yes, he is dead; how wilt thou do for a father?"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,4,2,SON,1,"Nay, how will you do for a husband?"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,4,2,LADY MACDUFF,1,"Why, I can buy me twenty at any market."
The Tragedy of Macbeth,4,2,SON,1,Then you'll buy 'em to sell again.
The Tragedy of Macbeth,4,2,LADY MACDUFF,1,"Thou speak'st with all thy wit: and yet, i' faith,"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,4,2,LADY MACDUFF,2,With wit enough for thee.
The Tragedy of Macbeth,4,2,SON,1,"Was my father a traitor, mother?"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,4,2,LADY MACDUFF,1,"Ay, that he was."
The Tragedy of Macbeth,4,2,SON,1,What is a traitor?
The Tragedy of Macbeth,4,2,LADY MACDUFF,1,"Why, one that swears and lies."
The Tragedy of Macbeth,4,2,SON,1,And be all traitors that do so?
The Tragedy of Macbeth,4,2,LADY MACDUFF,1,"Every one that does so is a traitor, and must be hanged."
The Tragedy of Macbeth,4,2,SON,1,And must they all be hanged that swear and lie?
The Tragedy of Macbeth,4,2,LADY MACDUFF,1,Every one.
The Tragedy of Macbeth,4,2,SON,1,Who must hang them?
The Tragedy of Macbeth,4,2,LADY MACDUFF,1,"Why, the honest men."
The Tragedy of Macbeth,4,2,SON,1,"Then the liars and swearers are fools,"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,4,2,SON,2,for there are liars and swearers enow to beat
The Tragedy of Macbeth,4,2,SON,3,the honest men and hang up them.
The Tragedy of Macbeth,4,2,LADY MACDUFF,1,"Now, God help thee, poor monkey!"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,4,2,LADY MACDUFF,2,But how wilt thou do for a father?
The Tragedy of Macbeth,4,2,SON,1,"If he were dead, you'ld weep for"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,4,2,SON,2,"him: if you would not, it were a good sign"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,4,2,SON,3,that I should quickly have a new father.
The Tragedy of Macbeth,4,2,LADY MACDUFF,1,"Poor prattler, how thou talk'st!"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,4,2,MESSENGER,1,"Bless you, fair dame! I am not to you known,"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,4,2,MESSENGER,2,Though in your state of honour I am perfect.
The Tragedy of Macbeth,4,2,MESSENGER,3,I doubt some danger does approach you nearly:
The Tragedy of Macbeth,4,2,MESSENGER,4,"If you will take a homely man's advice,"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,4,2,MESSENGER,5,"Be not found here; hence, with your little ones."
The Tragedy of Macbeth,4,2,MESSENGER,6,"To fright you thus, methinks, I am too savage;"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,4,2,MESSENGER,7,"To do worse to you were fell cruelty,"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,4,2,MESSENGER,8,Which is too nigh your person. Heaven preserve you!
The Tragedy of Macbeth,4,2,MESSENGER,9,I dare abide no longer.
The Tragedy of Macbeth,4,2,LADY MACDUFF,1,Whither should I fly?
The Tragedy of Macbeth,4,2,LADY MACDUFF,2,I have done no harm. But I remember now
The Tragedy of Macbeth,4,2,LADY MACDUFF,3,I am in this earthly world; where to do harm
The Tragedy of Macbeth,4,2,LADY MACDUFF,4,"Is often laudable, to do good sometime"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,4,2,LADY MACDUFF,5,"Accounted dangerous folly: why then, alas,"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,4,2,LADY MACDUFF,6,"Do I put up that womanly defence,"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,4,2,LADY MACDUFF,7,To say I have done no harm?
The Tragedy of Macbeth,4,2,LADY MACDUFF,8,What are these faces?
The Tragedy of Macbeth,4,2,FIRST MURDERER,1,Where is your husband?
The Tragedy of Macbeth,4,2,LADY MACDUFF,1,"I hope, in no place so unsanctified"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,4,2,LADY MACDUFF,2,Where such as thou mayst find him.
The Tragedy of Macbeth,4,2,FIRST MURDERER,1,He's a traitor.
The Tragedy of Macbeth,4,2,SON,1,"Thou liest, thou shag-hair'd villain!"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,4,2,FIRST MURDERER,1,"What, you egg!"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,4,2,FIRST MURDERER,2,Young fry of treachery!
The Tragedy of Macbeth,4,2,SON,1,"He has kill'd me, mother:"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,4,2,SON,2,"Run away, I pray you!"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,4,3,MALCOLM,1,"Let us seek out some desolate shade, and there"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,4,3,MALCOLM,2,Weep our sad bosoms empty.
The Tragedy of Macbeth,4,3,MACDUFF,1,Let us rather
The Tragedy of Macbeth,4,3,MACDUFF,2,"Hold fast the mortal sword, and like good men"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,4,3,MACDUFF,3,Bestride our down-fall'n birthdom: each new morn
The Tragedy of Macbeth,4,3,MACDUFF,4,"New widows howl, new orphans cry, new sorrows"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,4,3,MACDUFF,5,"Strike heaven on the face, that it resounds"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,4,3,MACDUFF,6,As if it felt with Scotland and yell'd out
The Tragedy of Macbeth,4,3,MACDUFF,7,Like syllable of dolour.
The Tragedy of Macbeth,4,3,MALCOLM,1,"What I believe I'll wail,"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,4,3,MALCOLM,2,"What know believe, and what I can redress,"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,4,3,MALCOLM,3,"As I shall find the time to friend, I will."
The Tragedy of Macbeth,4,3,MALCOLM,4,"What you have spoke, it may be so perchance."
The Tragedy of Macbeth,4,3,MALCOLM,5,"This tyrant, whose sole name blisters our tongues,"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,4,3,MALCOLM,6,Was once thought honest: you have loved him well.
The Tragedy of Macbeth,4,3,MALCOLM,7,He hath not touch'd you yet. I am young;
The Tragedy of Macbeth,4,3,MALCOLM,8,but something
The Tragedy of Macbeth,4,3,MALCOLM,9,"You may deserve of him through me, and wisdom"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,4,3,MALCOLM,10,To offer up a weak poor innocent lamb
The Tragedy of Macbeth,4,3,MALCOLM,11,To appease an angry god.
The Tragedy of Macbeth,4,3,MACDUFF,1,I am not treacherous.
The Tragedy of Macbeth,4,3,MALCOLM,1,But Macbeth is.
The Tragedy of Macbeth,4,3,MALCOLM,2,A good and virtuous nature may recoil
The Tragedy of Macbeth,4,3,MALCOLM,3,In an imperial charge. But I shall crave
The Tragedy of Macbeth,4,3,MALCOLM,4,your pardon;
The Tragedy of Macbeth,4,3,MALCOLM,5,That which you are my thoughts cannot transpose:
The Tragedy of Macbeth,4,3,MALCOLM,6,"Angels are bright still, though the brightest fell;"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,4,3,MALCOLM,7,"Though all things foul would wear the brows of grace,"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,4,3,MALCOLM,8,Yet grace must still look so.
The Tragedy of Macbeth,4,3,MACDUFF,1,I have lost my hopes.
The Tragedy of Macbeth,4,3,MALCOLM,1,Perchance even there where I did find my doubts.
The Tragedy of Macbeth,4,3,MALCOLM,2,"Why in that rawness left you wife and child,"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,4,3,MALCOLM,3,"Those precious motives, those strong knots of love,"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,4,3,MALCOLM,4,"Without leave-taking? I pray you,"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,4,3,MALCOLM,5,"Let not my jealousies be your dishonours,"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,4,3,MALCOLM,6,"But mine own safeties. You may be rightly just,"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,4,3,MALCOLM,7,Whatever I shall think.
The Tragedy of Macbeth,4,3,MACDUFF,1,"Bleed, bleed, poor country!"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,4,3,MACDUFF,2,"Great tyranny! lay thou thy basis sure,"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,4,3,MACDUFF,3,For goodness dare not cheque thee: wear thou
The Tragedy of Macbeth,4,3,MACDUFF,4,thy wrongs;
The Tragedy of Macbeth,4,3,MACDUFF,5,"The title is affeer'd! Fare thee well, lord:"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,4,3,MACDUFF,6,I would not be the villain that thou think'st
The Tragedy of Macbeth,4,3,MACDUFF,7,"For the whole space that's in the tyrant's grasp,"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,4,3,MACDUFF,8,And the rich East to boot.
The Tragedy of Macbeth,4,3,MALCOLM,1,Be not offended:
The Tragedy of Macbeth,4,3,MALCOLM,2,I speak not as in absolute fear of you.
The Tragedy of Macbeth,4,3,MALCOLM,3,I think our country sinks beneath the yoke;
The Tragedy of Macbeth,4,3,MALCOLM,4,"It weeps, it bleeds; and each new day a gash"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,4,3,MALCOLM,5,Is added to her wounds: I think withal
The Tragedy of Macbeth,4,3,MALCOLM,6,There would be hands uplifted in my right;
The Tragedy of Macbeth,4,3,MALCOLM,7,And here from gracious England have I offer
The Tragedy of Macbeth,4,3,MALCOLM,8,"Of goodly thousands: but, for all this,"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,4,3,MALCOLM,9,"When I shall tread upon the tyrant's head,"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,4,3,MALCOLM,10,"Or wear it on my sword, yet my poor country"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,4,3,MALCOLM,11,"Shall have more vices than it had before,"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,4,3,MALCOLM,12,"More suffer and more sundry ways than ever,"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,4,3,MALCOLM,13,By him that shall succeed.
The Tragedy of Macbeth,4,3,MACDUFF,1,What should he be?
The Tragedy of Macbeth,4,3,MALCOLM,1,It is myself I mean: in whom I know
The Tragedy of Macbeth,4,3,MALCOLM,2,All the particulars of vice so grafted
The Tragedy of Macbeth,4,3,MALCOLM,3,"That, when they shall be open'd, black Macbeth"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,4,3,MALCOLM,4,"Will seem as pure as snow, and the poor state"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,4,3,MALCOLM,5,"Esteem him as a lamb, being compared"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,4,3,MALCOLM,6,With my confineless harms.
The Tragedy of Macbeth,4,3,MACDUFF,1,Not in the legions
The Tragedy of Macbeth,4,3,MACDUFF,2,Of horrid hell can come a devil more damn'd
The Tragedy of Macbeth,4,3,MACDUFF,3,In evils to top Macbeth.
The Tragedy of Macbeth,4,3,MALCOLM,1,"I grant him bloody,"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,4,3,MALCOLM,2,"Luxurious, avaricious, false, deceitful,"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,4,3,MALCOLM,3,"Sudden, malicious, smacking of every sin"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,4,3,MALCOLM,4,"That has a name: but there's no bottom, none,"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,4,3,MALCOLM,5,"In my voluptuousness: your wives, your daughters,"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,4,3,MALCOLM,6,"Your matrons and your maids, could not fill up"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,4,3,MALCOLM,7,"The cistern of my lust, and my desire"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,4,3,MALCOLM,8,All continent impediments would o'erbear
The Tragedy of Macbeth,4,3,MALCOLM,9,That did oppose my will: better Macbeth
The Tragedy of Macbeth,4,3,MALCOLM,10,Than such an one to reign.
The Tragedy of Macbeth,4,3,MACDUFF,1,Boundless intemperance
The Tragedy of Macbeth,4,3,MACDUFF,2,In nature is a tyranny; it hath been
The Tragedy of Macbeth,4,3,MACDUFF,3,The untimely emptying of the happy throne
The Tragedy of Macbeth,4,3,MACDUFF,4,And fall of many kings. But fear not yet
The Tragedy of Macbeth,4,3,MACDUFF,5,To take upon you what is yours: you may
The Tragedy of Macbeth,4,3,MACDUFF,6,"Convey your pleasures in a spacious plenty,"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,4,3,MACDUFF,7,"And yet seem cold, the time you may so hoodwink."
The Tragedy of Macbeth,4,3,MACDUFF,8,We have willing dames enough: there cannot be
The Tragedy of Macbeth,4,3,MACDUFF,9,"That vulture in you, to devour so many"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,4,3,MACDUFF,10,"As will to greatness dedicate themselves,"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,4,3,MACDUFF,11,Finding it so inclined.
The Tragedy of Macbeth,4,3,MALCOLM,1,With this there grows
The Tragedy of Macbeth,4,3,MALCOLM,2,In my most ill-composed affection such
The Tragedy of Macbeth,4,3,MALCOLM,3,"A stanchless avarice that, were I king,"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,4,3,MALCOLM,4,"I should cut off the nobles for their lands,"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,4,3,MALCOLM,5,Desire his jewels and this other's house:
The Tragedy of Macbeth,4,3,MALCOLM,6,And my more-having would be as a sauce
The Tragedy of Macbeth,4,3,MALCOLM,7,To make me hunger more; that I should forge
The Tragedy of Macbeth,4,3,MALCOLM,8,"Quarrels unjust against the good and loyal,"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,4,3,MALCOLM,9,Destroying them for wealth.
The Tragedy of Macbeth,4,3,MACDUFF,1,This avarice
The Tragedy of Macbeth,4,3,MACDUFF,2,"Sticks deeper, grows with more pernicious root"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,4,3,MACDUFF,3,"Than summer-seeming lust, and it hath been"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,4,3,MACDUFF,4,The sword of our slain kings: yet do not fear;
The Tragedy of Macbeth,4,3,MACDUFF,5,Scotland hath foisons to fill up your will.
The Tragedy of Macbeth,4,3,MACDUFF,6,"Of your mere own: all these are portable,"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,4,3,MACDUFF,7,With other graces weigh'd.
The Tragedy of Macbeth,4,3,MALCOLM,1,"But I have none: the king-becoming graces,"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,4,3,MALCOLM,2,"As justice, verity, temperance, stableness,"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,4,3,MALCOLM,3,"Bounty, perseverance, mercy, lowliness,"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,4,3,MALCOLM,4,"Devotion, patience, courage, fortitude,"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,4,3,MALCOLM,5,"I have no relish of them, but abound"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,4,3,MALCOLM,6,"In the division of each several crime,"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,4,3,MALCOLM,7,"Acting it many ways. Nay, had I power, I should"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,4,3,MALCOLM,8,"Pour the sweet milk of concord into hell,"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,4,3,MALCOLM,9,"Uproar the universal peace, confound"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,4,3,MALCOLM,10,All unity on earth.
The Tragedy of Macbeth,4,3,MACDUFF,1,"O Scotland, Scotland!"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,4,3,MALCOLM,1,"If such a one be fit to govern, speak:"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,4,3,MALCOLM,2,I am as I have spoken.
The Tragedy of Macbeth,4,3,MACDUFF,1,Fit to govern!
The Tragedy of Macbeth,4,3,MACDUFF,2,"No, not to live. O nation miserable,"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,4,3,MACDUFF,3,"With an untitled tyrant bloody-scepter'd,"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,4,3,MACDUFF,4,"When shalt thou see thy wholesome days again,"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,4,3,MACDUFF,5,Since that the truest issue of thy throne
The Tragedy of Macbeth,4,3,MACDUFF,6,"By his own interdiction stands accursed,"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,4,3,MACDUFF,7,And does blaspheme his breed? Thy royal father
The Tragedy of Macbeth,4,3,MACDUFF,8,"Was a most sainted king: the queen that bore thee,"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,4,3,MACDUFF,9,"Oftener upon her knees than on her feet,"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,4,3,MACDUFF,10,Died every day she lived. Fare thee well!
The Tragedy of Macbeth,4,3,MACDUFF,11,These evils thou repeat'st upon thyself
The Tragedy of Macbeth,4,3,MACDUFF,12,"Have banish'd me from Scotland. O my breast,"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,4,3,MACDUFF,13,Thy hope ends here!
The Tragedy of Macbeth,4,3,MALCOLM,1,"Macduff, this noble passion,"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,4,3,MALCOLM,2,"Child of integrity, hath from my soul"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,4,3,MALCOLM,3,"Wiped the black scruples, reconciled my thoughts"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,4,3,MALCOLM,4,To thy good truth and honour. Devilish Macbeth
The Tragedy of Macbeth,4,3,MALCOLM,5,By many of these trains hath sought to win me
The Tragedy of Macbeth,4,3,MALCOLM,6,"Into his power, and modest wisdom plucks me"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,4,3,MALCOLM,7,From over-credulous haste: but God above
The Tragedy of Macbeth,4,3,MALCOLM,8,Deal between thee and me! for even now
The Tragedy of Macbeth,4,3,MALCOLM,9,"I put myself to thy direction, and"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,4,3,MALCOLM,10,"Unspeak mine own detraction, here abjure"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,4,3,MALCOLM,11,"The taints and blames I laid upon myself,"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,4,3,MALCOLM,12,For strangers to my nature. I am yet
The Tragedy of Macbeth,4,3,MALCOLM,13,"Unknown to woman, never was forsworn,"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,4,3,MALCOLM,14,"Scarcely have coveted what was mine own,"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,4,3,MALCOLM,15,"At no time broke my faith, would not betray"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,4,3,MALCOLM,16,The devil to his fellow and delight
The Tragedy of Macbeth,4,3,MALCOLM,17,No less in truth than life: my first false speaking
The Tragedy of Macbeth,4,3,MALCOLM,18,"Was this upon myself: what I am truly,"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,4,3,MALCOLM,19,Is thine and my poor country's to command:
The Tragedy of Macbeth,4,3,MALCOLM,20,"Whither indeed, before thy here-approach,"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,4,3,MALCOLM,21,"Old Siward, with ten thousand warlike men,"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,4,3,MALCOLM,22,"Already at a point, was setting forth."
The Tragedy of Macbeth,4,3,MALCOLM,23,Now we'll together; and the chance of goodness
The Tragedy of Macbeth,4,3,MALCOLM,24,Be like our warranted quarrel! Why are you silent?
The Tragedy of Macbeth,4,3,MACDUFF,1,Such welcome and unwelcome things at once
The Tragedy of Macbeth,4,3,MACDUFF,2,'Tis hard to reconcile.
The Tragedy of Macbeth,4,3,MALCOLM,1,"Well; more anon.--Comes the king forth, I pray you?"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,4,3,DOCTOR,1,"Ay, sir; there are a crew of wretched souls"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,4,3,DOCTOR,2,That stay his cure: their malady convinces
The Tragedy of Macbeth,4,3,DOCTOR,3,The great assay of art; but at his touch--
The Tragedy of Macbeth,4,3,DOCTOR,4,Such sanctity hath heaven given his hand--
The Tragedy of Macbeth,4,3,DOCTOR,5,They presently amend.
The Tragedy of Macbeth,4,3,MALCOLM,1,"I thank you, doctor."
The Tragedy of Macbeth,4,3,MACDUFF,1,What's the disease he means?
The Tragedy of Macbeth,4,3,MALCOLM,1,'Tis call'd the evil:
The Tragedy of Macbeth,4,3,MALCOLM,2,A most miraculous work in this good king;

The Tragedy of Macbeth,4,3,MACDUFF,1,"See, who comes here?"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,4,3,MALCOLM,1,My countryman; but yet I know him not.
The Tragedy of Macbeth,4,3,MACDUFF,1,"My ever-gentle cousin, welcome hither."
The Tragedy of Macbeth,4,3,MALCOLM,1,"I know him now. Good God, betimes remove"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,4,3,MALCOLM,2,The means that makes us strangers!
The Tragedy of Macbeth,4,3,ROSS,1,"Sir, amen."
The Tragedy of Macbeth,4,3,MACDUFF,1,Stands Scotland where it did?
The Tragedy of Macbeth,4,3,ROSS,1,"Alas, poor country!"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,4,3,ROSS,2,Almost afraid to know itself. It cannot
The Tragedy of Macbeth,4,3,ROSS,3,"Be call'd our mother, but our grave; where nothing,"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,4,3,ROSS,4,"But who knows nothing, is once seen to smile;"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,4,3,ROSS,5,Where sighs and groans and shrieks that rend the air
The Tragedy of Macbeth,4,3,ROSS,6,"Are made, not mark'd; where violent sorrow seems"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,4,3,ROSS,7,A modern ecstasy; the dead man's knell
The Tragedy of Macbeth,4,3,ROSS,8,Is there scarce ask'd for who; and good men's lives
The Tragedy of Macbeth,4,3,ROSS,9,"Expire before the flowers in their caps,"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,4,3,ROSS,10,Dying or ere they sicken.
The Tragedy of Macbeth,4,3,MACDUFF,1,"O, relation"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,4,3,MACDUFF,2,"Too nice, and yet too true!"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,4,3,MALCOLM,1,What's the newest grief?
The Tragedy of Macbeth,4,3,ROSS,1,That of an hour's age doth hiss the speaker:
The Tragedy of Macbeth,4,3,ROSS,2,Each minute teems a new one.
The Tragedy of Macbeth,4,3,MACDUFF,1,How does my wife?
The Tragedy of Macbeth,4,3,ROSS,1,"Why, well."
The Tragedy of Macbeth,4,3,MACDUFF,1,And all my children?
The Tragedy of Macbeth,4,3,ROSS,1,Well too.
The Tragedy of Macbeth,4,3,MACDUFF,1,The tyrant has not batter'd at their peace?
The Tragedy of Macbeth,4,3,ROSS,1,No; they were well at peace when I did leave 'em.
The Tragedy of Macbeth,4,3,MACDUFF,1,But not a niggard of your speech: how goes't?
The Tragedy of Macbeth,4,3,ROSS,1,"When I came hither to transport the tidings,"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,4,3,ROSS,2,"Which I have heavily borne, there ran a rumour"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,4,3,ROSS,3,Of many worthy fellows that were out;
The Tragedy of Macbeth,4,3,ROSS,4,"Which was to my belief witness'd the rather,"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,4,3,ROSS,5,For that I saw the tyrant's power a-foot:
The Tragedy of Macbeth,4,3,ROSS,6,Now is the time of help; your eye in Scotland
The Tragedy of Macbeth,4,3,ROSS,7,"Would create soldiers, make our women fight,"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,4,3,ROSS,8,To doff their dire distresses.
The Tragedy of Macbeth,4,3,MALCOLM,1,Be't their comfort
The Tragedy of Macbeth,4,3,MALCOLM,2,We are coming thither: gracious England hath
The Tragedy of Macbeth,4,3,MALCOLM,3,Lent us good Siward and ten thousand men;
The Tragedy of Macbeth,4,3,MALCOLM,4,An older and a better soldier none
The Tragedy of Macbeth,4,3,MALCOLM,5,That Christendom gives out.
The Tragedy of Macbeth,4,3,ROSS,1,Would I could answer
The Tragedy of Macbeth,4,3,ROSS,2,This comfort with the like! But I have words
The Tragedy of Macbeth,4,3,ROSS,3,"That would be howl'd out in the desert air,"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,4,3,ROSS,4,Where hearing should not latch them.
The Tragedy of Macbeth,4,3,MACDUFF,1,What concern they?
The Tragedy of Macbeth,4,3,MACDUFF,2,The general cause? or is it a fee-grief
The Tragedy of Macbeth,4,3,MACDUFF,3,Due to some single breast?
The Tragedy of Macbeth,4,3,ROSS,1,No mind that's honest
The Tragedy of Macbeth,4,3,ROSS,2,But in it shares some woe; though the main part
The Tragedy of Macbeth,4,3,ROSS,3,Pertains to you alone.
The Tragedy of Macbeth,4,3,MACDUFF,1,"If it be mine,"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,4,3,MACDUFF,2,"Keep it not from me, quickly let me have it."
The Tragedy of Macbeth,4,3,ROSS,1,"Let not your ears despise my tongue for ever,"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,4,3,ROSS,2,Which shall possess them with the heaviest sound
The Tragedy of Macbeth,4,3,ROSS,3,That ever yet they heard.
The Tragedy of Macbeth,4,3,MACDUFF,1,Hum! I guess at it.
The Tragedy of Macbeth,4,3,ROSS,1,Your castle is surprised; your wife and babes
The Tragedy of Macbeth,4,3,ROSS,2,"Savagely slaughter'd: to relate the manner,"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,4,3,ROSS,3,"Were, on the quarry of these murder'd deer,"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,4,3,ROSS,4,To add the death of you.
The Tragedy of Macbeth,4,3,MALCOLM,1,Merciful heaven!
The Tragedy of Macbeth,4,3,MALCOLM,2,"What, man! ne'er pull your hat upon your brows;"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,4,3,MALCOLM,3,Give sorrow words: the grief that does not speak
The Tragedy of Macbeth,4,3,MALCOLM,4,Whispers the o'er-fraught heart and bids it break.
The Tragedy of Macbeth,4,3,MACDUFF,1,My children too?
The Tragedy of Macbeth,4,3,ROSS,1,"Wife, children, servants, all"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,4,3,ROSS,2,That could be found.
The Tragedy of Macbeth,4,3,MACDUFF,1,And I must be from thence!
The Tragedy of Macbeth,4,3,MACDUFF,2,My wife kill'd too?
The Tragedy of Macbeth,4,3,ROSS,1,I have said.
The Tragedy of Macbeth,4,3,MALCOLM,1,Be comforted:
The Tragedy of Macbeth,4,3,MALCOLM,2,"Let's make us medicines of our great revenge,"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,4,3,MALCOLM,3,To cure this deadly grief.
The Tragedy of Macbeth,4,3,MACDUFF,1,He has no children. All my pretty ones?
The Tragedy of Macbeth,4,3,MACDUFF,2,Did you say all? O hell-kite! All?
The Tragedy of Macbeth,4,3,MACDUFF,3,"What, all my pretty chickens and their dam"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,4,3,MACDUFF,4,At one fell swoop?
The Tragedy of Macbeth,4,3,MALCOLM,1,Dispute it like a man.
The Tragedy of Macbeth,4,3,MACDUFF,1,I shall do so;
The Tragedy of Macbeth,4,3,MACDUFF,2,But I must also feel it as a man:
The Tragedy of Macbeth,4,3,MACDUFF,3,"I cannot but remember such things were,"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,4,3,MACDUFF,4,"That were most precious to me. Did heaven look on,"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,4,3,MACDUFF,5,"And would not take their part? Sinful Macduff,"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,4,3,MACDUFF,6,"They were all struck for thee! naught that I am,"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,4,3,MACDUFF,7,"Not for their own demerits, but for mine,"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,4,3,MACDUFF,8,Fell slaughter on their souls. Heaven rest them now!
The Tragedy of Macbeth,4,3,MALCOLM,1,Be this the whetstone of your sword: let grief
The Tragedy of Macbeth,4,3,MALCOLM,2,"Convert to anger; blunt not the heart, enrage it."
The Tragedy of Macbeth,4,3,MACDUFF,1,"O, I could play the woman with mine eyes"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,4,3,MACDUFF,2,"And braggart with my tongue! But, gentle heavens,"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,4,3,MACDUFF,3,Cut short all intermission; front to front
The Tragedy of Macbeth,4,3,MACDUFF,4,Bring thou this fiend of Scotland and myself;
The Tragedy of Macbeth,4,3,MACDUFF,5,"Within my sword's length set him; if he 'scape,"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,4,3,MACDUFF,6,Heaven forgive him too!
The Tragedy of Macbeth,4,3,MALCOLM,1,This tune goes manly.
The Tragedy of Macbeth,4,3,MALCOLM,2,"Come, go we to the king; our power is ready;"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,4,3,MALCOLM,3,Our lack is nothing but our leave; Macbeth
The Tragedy of Macbeth,4,3,MALCOLM,4,"Is ripe for shaking, and the powers above"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,4,3,MALCOLM,5,Put on their instruments. Receive what cheer you may:
The Tragedy of Macbeth,4,3,MALCOLM,6,The night is long that never finds the day.
The Tragedy of Macbeth,5,1,DOCTOR,1,"I have two nights watched with you, but can perceive"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,5,1,DOCTOR,2,no truth in your report. When was it she last walked?
The Tragedy of Macbeth,5,1,GENTLEWOMAN,1,"Since his majesty went into the field, I have seen"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,5,1,GENTLEWOMAN,2,"her rise from her bed, throw her night-gown upon"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,5,1,GENTLEWOMAN,3,"her, unlock her closet, take forth paper, fold it,"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,5,1,GENTLEWOMAN,4,"write upon't, read it, afterwards seal it, and again"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,5,1,GENTLEWOMAN,5,return to bed; yet all this while in a most fast sleep.
The Tragedy of Macbeth,5,1,DOCTOR,1,"A great perturbation in nature, to receive at once"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,5,1,DOCTOR,2,"the benefit of sleep, and do the effects of"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,5,1,DOCTOR,3,"watching! In this slumbery agitation, besides her"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,5,1,DOCTOR,4,"walking and other actual performances, what, at any"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,5,1,DOCTOR,5,"time, have you heard her say?"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,5,1,GENTLEWOMAN,1,"That, sir, which I will not report after her."
The Tragedy of Macbeth,5,1,DOCTOR,1,You may to me: and 'tis most meet you should.
The Tragedy of Macbeth,5,1,GENTLEWOMAN,1,Neither to you nor any one; having no witness to
The Tragedy of Macbeth,5,1,GENTLEWOMAN,2,confirm my speech.
The Tragedy of Macbeth,5,1,GENTLEWOMAN,3,"Lo you, here she comes! This is her very guise;"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,5,1,GENTLEWOMAN,4,"and, upon my life, fast asleep. Observe her; stand close."
The Tragedy of Macbeth,5,1,DOCTOR,1,How came she by that light?
The Tragedy of Macbeth,5,1,GENTLEWOMAN,1,"Why, it stood by her: she has light by her"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,5,1,GENTLEWOMAN,2,continually; 'tis her command.
The Tragedy of Macbeth,5,1,DOCTOR,1,"You see, her eyes are open."
The Tragedy of Macbeth,5,1,GENTLEWOMAN,1,"Ay, but their sense is shut."
The Tragedy of Macbeth,5,1,DOCTOR,1,"What is it she does now? Look, how she rubs her hands."
The Tragedy of Macbeth,5,1,GENTLEWOMAN,1,"It is an accustomed action with her, to seem thus"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,5,1,GENTLEWOMAN,2,washing her hands: I have known her continue in
The Tragedy of Macbeth,5,1,GENTLEWOMAN,3,this a quarter of an hour.
The Tragedy of Macbeth,5,1,LADY MACBETH,1,Yet here's a spot.
The Tragedy of Macbeth,5,1,DOCTOR,1,Hark! she speaks: I will set down what comes from
The Tragedy of Macbeth,5,1,DOCTOR,2,"her, to satisfy my remembrance the more strongly."
The Tragedy of Macbeth,5,1,LADY MACBETH,1,"Out, damned spot! out, I say!--One: two: why,"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,5,1,LADY MACBETH,2,"then, 'tis time to do't.--Hell is murky!--Fie, my"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,5,1,LADY MACBETH,3,"lord, fie! a soldier, and afeard? What need we"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,5,1,LADY MACBETH,4,"fear who knows it, when none can call our power to"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,5,1,LADY MACBETH,5,account?--Yet who would have thought the old man
The Tragedy of Macbeth,5,1,LADY MACBETH,6,to have had so much blood in him.
The Tragedy of Macbeth,5,1,DOCTOR,1,Do you mark that?
The Tragedy of Macbeth,5,1,LADY MACBETH,1,The thane of Fife had a wife: where is she now?--
The Tragedy of Macbeth,5,1,LADY MACBETH,2,"What, will these hands ne'er be clean?--No more o'"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,5,1,LADY MACBETH,3,"that, my lord, no more o' that: you mar all with"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,5,1,LADY MACBETH,4,this starting.
The Tragedy of Macbeth,5,1,DOCTOR,1,"Go to, go to; you have known what you should not."
The Tragedy of Macbeth,5,1,GENTLEWOMAN,1,"She has spoke what she should not, I am sure of"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,5,1,GENTLEWOMAN,2,that: heaven knows what she has known.
The Tragedy of Macbeth,5,1,LADY MACBETH,1,Here's the smell of the blood still: all the
The Tragedy of Macbeth,5,1,LADY MACBETH,2,perfumes of Arabia will not sweeten this little
The Tragedy of Macbeth,5,1,LADY MACBETH,3,"hand. Oh, oh, oh!"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,5,1,DOCTOR,1,What a sigh is there! The heart is sorely charged.
The Tragedy of Macbeth,5,1,GENTLEWOMAN,1,I would not have such a heart in my bosom for the
The Tragedy of Macbeth,5,1,GENTLEWOMAN,2,dignity of the whole body.
The Tragedy of Macbeth,5,1,DOCTOR,1,"Well, well, well,--"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,5,1,GENTLEWOMAN,1,"Pray God it be, sir."
The Tragedy of Macbeth,5,1,DOCTOR,1,This disease is beyond my practise: yet I have known
The Tragedy of Macbeth,5,1,DOCTOR,2,those which have walked in their sleep who have died
The Tragedy of Macbeth,5,1,DOCTOR,3,holily in their beds.
The Tragedy of Macbeth,5,1,LADY MACBETH,1,"Wash your hands, put on your nightgown; look not so"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,5,1,LADY MACBETH,2,"pale.--I tell you yet again, Banquo's buried; he"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,5,1,LADY MACBETH,3,cannot come out on's grave.
The Tragedy of Macbeth,5,1,DOCTOR,1,Even so?
The Tragedy of Macbeth,5,1,LADY MACBETH,1,"To bed, to bed! there's knocking at the gate:"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,5,1,LADY MACBETH,2,"come, come, come, come, give me your hand. What's"

The Tragedy of Macbeth,5,1,DOCTOR,1,Will she go now to bed?
The Tragedy of Macbeth,5,1,GENTLEWOMAN,1,Directly.
The Tragedy of Macbeth,5,1,DOCTOR,1,Foul whisperings are abroad: unnatural deeds
The Tragedy of Macbeth,5,1,DOCTOR,2,Do breed unnatural troubles: infected minds
The Tragedy of Macbeth,5,1,DOCTOR,3,To their deaf pillows will discharge their secrets:
The Tragedy of Macbeth,5,1,DOCTOR,4,More needs she the divine than the physician.
The Tragedy of Macbeth,5,1,DOCTOR,5,"God, God forgive us all! Look after her;"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,5,1,DOCTOR,6,"Remove from her the means of all annoyance,"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,5,1,DOCTOR,7,"And still keep eyes upon her. So, good night:"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,5,1,DOCTOR,8,"My mind she has mated, and amazed my sight."
The Tragedy of Macbeth,5,1,DOCTOR,9,"I think, but dare not speak."
The Tragedy of Macbeth,5,1,GENTLEWOMAN,1,"Good night, good doctor."
The Tragedy of Macbeth,5,2,MENTEITH,1,"The English power is near, led on by Malcolm,"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,5,2,MENTEITH,2,His uncle Siward and the good Macduff:
The Tragedy of Macbeth,5,2,MENTEITH,3,Revenges burn in them; for their dear causes
The Tragedy of Macbeth,5,2,MENTEITH,4,Would to the bleeding and the grim alarm
The Tragedy of Macbeth,5,2,MENTEITH,5,Excite the mortified man.
The Tragedy of Macbeth,5,2,ANGUS,1,Near Birnam wood
The Tragedy of Macbeth,5,2,ANGUS,2,Shall we well meet them; that way are they coming.
The Tragedy of Macbeth,5,2,CAITHNESS,1,Who knows if Donalbain be with his brother?
The Tragedy of Macbeth,5,2,LENNOX,1,"For certain, sir, he is not: I have a file"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,5,2,LENNOX,2,"Of all the gentry: there is Siward's son,"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,5,2,LENNOX,3,And many unrough youths that even now
The Tragedy of Macbeth,5,2,LENNOX,4,Protest their first of manhood.
The Tragedy of Macbeth,5,2,MENTEITH,1,What does the tyrant?
The Tragedy of Macbeth,5,2,CAITHNESS,1,Great Dunsinane he strongly fortifies:
The Tragedy of Macbeth,5,2,CAITHNESS,2,Some say he's mad; others that lesser hate him
The Tragedy of Macbeth,5,2,CAITHNESS,3,"Do call it valiant fury: but, for certain,"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,5,2,CAITHNESS,4,He cannot buckle his distemper'd cause
The Tragedy of Macbeth,5,2,CAITHNESS,5,Within the belt of rule.
The Tragedy of Macbeth,5,2,ANGUS,1,Now does he feel
The Tragedy of Macbeth,5,2,ANGUS,2,His secret murders sticking on his hands;
The Tragedy of Macbeth,5,2,ANGUS,3,Now minutely revolts upbraid his faith-breach;
The Tragedy of Macbeth,5,2,ANGUS,4,"Those he commands move only in command,"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,5,2,ANGUS,5,Nothing in love: now does he feel his title
The Tragedy of Macbeth,5,2,ANGUS,6,"Hang loose about him, like a giant's robe"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,5,2,ANGUS,7,Upon a dwarfish thief.
The Tragedy of Macbeth,5,2,MENTEITH,1,Who then shall blame
The Tragedy of Macbeth,5,2,MENTEITH,2,"His pester'd senses to recoil and start,"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,5,2,MENTEITH,3,When all that is within him does condemn
The Tragedy of Macbeth,5,2,MENTEITH,4,Itself for being there?
The Tragedy of Macbeth,5,2,CAITHNESS,1,"Well, march we on,"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,5,2,CAITHNESS,2,To give obedience where 'tis truly owed:
The Tragedy of Macbeth,5,2,CAITHNESS,3,"Meet we the medicine of the sickly weal,"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,5,2,CAITHNESS,4,And with him pour we in our country's purge
The Tragedy of Macbeth,5,2,CAITHNESS,5,Each drop of us.
The Tragedy of Macbeth,5,2,LENNOX,1,"Or so much as it needs,"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,5,2,LENNOX,2,To dew the sovereign flower and drown the weeds.
The Tragedy of Macbeth,5,2,LENNOX,3,Make we our march towards Birnam.
The Tragedy of Macbeth,5,3,MACBETH,1,Bring me no more reports; let them fly all:
The Tragedy of Macbeth,5,3,MACBETH,2,"Till Birnam wood remove to Dunsinane,"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,5,3,MACBETH,3,I cannot taint with fear. What's the boy Malcolm?
The Tragedy of Macbeth,5,3,MACBETH,4,Was he not born of woman? The spirits that know
The Tragedy of Macbeth,5,3,MACBETH,5,All mortal consequences have pronounced me thus:
The Tragedy of Macbeth,5,3,MACBETH,6,"'Fear not, Macbeth; no man that's born of woman"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,5,3,MACBETH,7,"Shall e'er have power upon thee.' Then fly,"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,5,3,MACBETH,8,"false thanes,"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,5,3,MACBETH,9,And mingle with the English epicures:
The Tragedy of Macbeth,5,3,MACBETH,10,The mind I sway by and the heart I bear
The Tragedy of Macbeth,5,3,MACBETH,11,Shall never sag with doubt nor shake with fear.
The Tragedy of Macbeth,5,3,MACBETH,12,"The devil damn thee black, thou cream-faced loon!"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,5,3,MACBETH,13,Where got'st thou that goose look?
The Tragedy of Macbeth,5,3,SERVANT,1,There is ten thousand--
The Tragedy of Macbeth,5,3,MACBETH,1,"Geese, villain!"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,5,3,SERVANT,1,"Soldiers, sir."
The Tragedy of Macbeth,5,3,MACBETH,1,"Go prick thy face, and over-red thy fear,"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,5,3,MACBETH,2,"Thou lily-liver'd boy. What soldiers, patch?"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,5,3,MACBETH,3,Death of thy soul! those linen cheeks of thine
The Tragedy of Macbeth,5,3,MACBETH,4,"Are counsellors to fear. What soldiers, whey-face?"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,5,3,SERVANT,1,"The English force, so please you."
The Tragedy of Macbeth,5,3,MACBETH,1,Take thy face hence.
The Tragedy of Macbeth,5,3,MACBETH,2,"Seyton!--I am sick at heart,"

The Tragedy of Macbeth,5,3,MACBETH,4,"Will cheer me ever, or disseat me now."
The Tragedy of Macbeth,5,3,MACBETH,5,I have lived long enough: my way of life
The Tragedy of Macbeth,5,3,MACBETH,6,"Is fall'n into the sear, the yellow leaf;"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,5,3,MACBETH,7,"And that which should accompany old age,"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,5,3,MACBETH,8,"As honour, love, obedience, troops of friends,"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,5,3,MACBETH,9,"I must not look to have; but, in their stead,"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,5,3,MACBETH,10,"Curses, not loud but deep, mouth-honour, breath,"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,5,3,MACBETH,11,"Which the poor heart would fain deny, and dare not. Seyton!"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,5,3,SEYTON,1,What is your gracious pleasure?
The Tragedy of Macbeth,5,3,MACBETH,1,What news more?
The Tragedy of Macbeth,5,3,SEYTON,1,"All is confirm'd, my lord, which was reported."
The Tragedy of Macbeth,5,3,MACBETH,1,I'll fight till from my bones my flesh be hack'd.
The Tragedy of Macbeth,5,3,MACBETH,2,Give me my armour.
The Tragedy of Macbeth,5,3,SEYTON,1,'Tis not needed yet.
The Tragedy of Macbeth,5,3,MACBETH,1,I'll put it on.
The Tragedy of Macbeth,5,3,MACBETH,2,Send out more horses; skirr the country round;
The Tragedy of Macbeth,5,3,MACBETH,3,Hang those that talk of fear. Give me mine armour.
The Tragedy of Macbeth,5,3,MACBETH,4,"How does your patient, doctor?"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,5,3,DOCTOR,1,"Not so sick, my lord,"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,5,3,DOCTOR,2,"As she is troubled with thick coming fancies,"

The Tragedy of Macbeth,5,3,MACBETH,4,Raze out the written troubles of the brain
The Tragedy of Macbeth,5,3,MACBETH,5,And with some sweet oblivious antidote
The Tragedy of Macbeth,5,3,MACBETH,6,Cleanse the stuff'd bosom of that perilous stuff
The Tragedy of Macbeth,5,3,MACBETH,7,Which weighs upon the heart?
The Tragedy of Macbeth,5,3,DOCTOR,1,Therein the patient
The Tragedy of Macbeth,5,3,DOCTOR,2,Must minister to himself.
The Tragedy of Macbeth,5,3,MACBETH,1,Throw physic to the dogs; I'll none of it.
The Tragedy of Macbeth,5,3,MACBETH,2,"Come, put mine armour on; give me my staff."
The Tragedy of Macbeth,5,3,MACBETH,3,"Seyton, send out. Doctor, the thanes fly from me."
The Tragedy of Macbeth,5,3,MACBETH,4,"Come, sir, dispatch. If thou couldst, doctor, cast"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,5,3,MACBETH,5,"The water of my land, find her disease,"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,5,3,MACBETH,6,"And purge it to a sound and pristine health,"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,5,3,MACBETH,7,"I would applaud thee to the very echo,"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,5,3,MACBETH,8,"That should applaud again.--Pull't off, I say.--"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,5,3,MACBETH,9,"What rhubarb, cyme, or what purgative drug,"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,5,3,MACBETH,10,Would scour these English hence? Hear'st thou of them?
The Tragedy of Macbeth,5,3,DOCTOR,1,"Ay, my good lord; your royal preparation"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,5,3,DOCTOR,2,Makes us hear something.
The Tragedy of Macbeth,5,3,MACBETH,1,Bring it after me.
The Tragedy of Macbeth,5,3,MACBETH,2,"I will not be afraid of death and bane,"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,5,3,MACBETH,3,Till Birnam forest come to Dunsinane.
The Tragedy of Macbeth,5,3,DOCTOR,1,Profit again should hardly draw me here.
The Tragedy of Macbeth,5,4,MALCOLM,1,"Cousins, I hope the days are near at hand"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,5,4,MALCOLM,2,That chambers will be safe.
The Tragedy of Macbeth,5,4,MENTEITH,1,We doubt it nothing.
The Tragedy of Macbeth,5,4,SIWARD,1,What wood is this before us?
The Tragedy of Macbeth,5,4,MENTEITH,1,The wood of Birnam.
The Tragedy of Macbeth,5,4,MALCOLM,1,Let every soldier hew him down a bough
The Tragedy of Macbeth,5,4,MALCOLM,2,And bear't before him: thereby shall we shadow
The Tragedy of Macbeth,5,4,MALCOLM,3,The numbers of our host and make discovery
The Tragedy of Macbeth,5,4,MALCOLM,4,Err in report of us.
The Tragedy of Macbeth,5,4,SOLDIERS,1,It shall be done.
The Tragedy of Macbeth,5,4,SIWARD,1,We learn no other but the confident tyrant
The Tragedy of Macbeth,5,4,SIWARD,2,"Keeps still in Dunsinane, and will endure"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,5,4,SIWARD,3,Our setting down before 't.
The Tragedy of Macbeth,5,4,MALCOLM,1,'Tis his main hope:

The Tragedy of Macbeth,5,4,MALCOLM,3,"Both more and less have given him the revolt,"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,5,4,MALCOLM,4,And none serve with him but constrained things
The Tragedy of Macbeth,5,4,MALCOLM,5,Whose hearts are absent too.
The Tragedy of Macbeth,5,4,MACDUFF,1,Let our just censures
The Tragedy of Macbeth,5,4,MACDUFF,2,"Attend the true event, and put we on"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,5,4,MACDUFF,3,Industrious soldiership.
The Tragedy of Macbeth,5,4,SIWARD,1,The time approaches
The Tragedy of Macbeth,5,4,SIWARD,2,That will with due decision make us know
The Tragedy of Macbeth,5,4,SIWARD,3,What we shall say we have and what we owe.
The Tragedy of Macbeth,5,4,SIWARD,4,"Thoughts speculative their unsure hopes relate,"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,5,4,SIWARD,5,But certain issue strokes must arbitrate:
The Tragedy of Macbeth,5,4,SIWARD,6,Towards which advance the war.
The Tragedy of Macbeth,5,5,MACBETH,1,Hang out our banners on the outward walls;
The Tragedy of Macbeth,5,5,MACBETH,2,The cry is still 'They come:' our castle's strength
The Tragedy of Macbeth,5,5,MACBETH,3,Will laugh a siege to scorn: here let them lie
The Tragedy of Macbeth,5,5,MACBETH,4,Till famine and the ague eat them up:
The Tragedy of Macbeth,5,5,MACBETH,5,"Were they not forced with those that should be ours,"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,5,5,MACBETH,6,"We might have met them dareful, beard to beard,"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,5,5,MACBETH,7,And beat them backward home.
The Tragedy of Macbeth,5,5,MACBETH,8,What is that noise?
The Tragedy of Macbeth,5,5,SEYTON,1,"It is the cry of women, my good lord."
The Tragedy of Macbeth,5,5,MACBETH,1,I have almost forgot the taste of fears;
The Tragedy of Macbeth,5,5,MACBETH,2,"The time has been, my senses would have cool'd"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,5,5,MACBETH,3,To hear a night-shriek; and my fell of hair
The Tragedy of Macbeth,5,5,MACBETH,4,Would at a dismal treatise rouse and stir
The Tragedy of Macbeth,5,5,MACBETH,5,As life were in't: I have supp'd full with horrors;
The Tragedy of Macbeth,5,5,MACBETH,6,"Direness, familiar to my slaughterous thoughts"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,5,5,MACBETH,7,Cannot once start me.
The Tragedy of Macbeth,5,5,MACBETH,8,Wherefore was that cry?
The Tragedy of Macbeth,5,5,SEYTON,1,"The queen, my lord, is dead."
The Tragedy of Macbeth,5,5,MACBETH,1,She should have died hereafter;
The Tragedy of Macbeth,5,5,MACBETH,2,There would have been a time for such a word.
The Tragedy of Macbeth,5,5,MACBETH,3,"To-morrow, and to-morrow, and to-morrow,"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,5,5,MACBETH,4,Creeps in this petty pace from day to day
The Tragedy of Macbeth,5,5,MACBETH,5,"To the last syllable of recorded time,"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,5,5,MACBETH,6,And all our yesterdays have lighted fools
The Tragedy of Macbeth,5,5,MACBETH,7,"The way to dusty death. Out, out, brief candle!"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,5,5,MACBETH,8,"Life's but a walking shadow, a poor player"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,5,5,MACBETH,9,That struts and frets his hour upon the stage
The Tragedy of Macbeth,5,5,MACBETH,10,And then is heard no more: it is a tale
The Tragedy of Macbeth,5,5,MACBETH,11,"Told by an idiot, full of sound and fury,"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,5,5,MACBETH,12,Signifying nothing.
The Tragedy of Macbeth,5,5,MACBETH,13,Thou comest to use thy tongue; thy story quickly.
The Tragedy of Macbeth,5,5,MESSENGER,1,"Gracious my lord,"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,5,5,MESSENGER,2,"I should report that which I say I saw,"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,5,5,MESSENGER,3,But know not how to do it.
The Tragedy of Macbeth,5,5,MACBETH,1,"Well, say, sir."
The Tragedy of Macbeth,5,5,MESSENGER,1,"As I did stand my watch upon the hill,"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,5,5,MESSENGER,2,"I look'd toward Birnam, and anon, methought,"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,5,5,MESSENGER,3,The wood began to move.
The Tragedy of Macbeth,5,5,MACBETH,1,Liar and slave!
The Tragedy of Macbeth,5,5,MESSENGER,1,"Let me endure your wrath, if't be not so:"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,5,5,MESSENGER,2,Within this three mile may you see it coming;
The Tragedy of Macbeth,5,5,MESSENGER,3,"I say, a moving grove."
The Tragedy of Macbeth,5,5,MACBETH,1,"If thou speak'st false,"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,5,5,MACBETH,2,"Upon the next tree shalt thou hang alive,"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,5,5,MACBETH,3,"Till famine cling thee: if thy speech be sooth,"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,5,5,MACBETH,4,I care not if thou dost for me as much.
The Tragedy of Macbeth,5,5,MACBETH,5,"I pull in resolution, and begin"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,5,5,MACBETH,6,To doubt the equivocation of the fiend
The Tragedy of Macbeth,5,5,MACBETH,7,"That lies like truth: 'Fear not, till Birnam wood"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,5,5,MACBETH,8,Do come to Dunsinane:'  and now a wood
The Tragedy of Macbeth,5,5,MACBETH,9,"Comes toward Dunsinane. Arm, arm, and out!"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,5,5,MACBETH,10,"If this which he avouches does appear,"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,5,5,MACBETH,11,There is nor flying hence nor tarrying here.
The Tragedy of Macbeth,5,5,MACBETH,12,"I gin to be aweary of the sun,"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,5,5,MACBETH,13,And wish the estate o' the world were now undone.
The Tragedy of Macbeth,5,5,MACBETH,14,"Ring the alarum-bell! Blow, wind! come, wrack!"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,5,5,MACBETH,15,At least we'll die with harness on our back.
The Tragedy of Macbeth,5,6,MALCOLM,1,Now near enough: your leafy screens throw down.
The Tragedy of Macbeth,5,6,MALCOLM,2,"And show like those you are. You, worthy uncle,"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,5,6,MALCOLM,3,"Shall, with my cousin, your right-noble son,"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,5,6,MALCOLM,4,Lead our first battle: worthy Macduff and we
The Tragedy of Macbeth,5,6,MALCOLM,5,"Shall take upon 's what else remains to do,"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,5,6,MALCOLM,6,According to our order.
The Tragedy of Macbeth,5,6,SIWARD,1,Fare you well.
The Tragedy of Macbeth,5,6,SIWARD,2,"Do we but find the tyrant's power to-night,"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,5,6,SIWARD,3,"Let us be beaten, if we cannot fight."
The Tragedy of Macbeth,5,6,MACDUFF,1,"Make all our trumpets speak; give them all breath,"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,5,6,MACDUFF,2,Those clamorous harbingers of blood and death.
The Tragedy of Macbeth,5,7,MACBETH,1,"They have tied me to a stake; I cannot fly,"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,5,7,MACBETH,2,"But, bear-like, I must fight the course. What's he"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,5,7,MACBETH,3,That was not born of woman? Such a one
The Tragedy of Macbeth,5,7,MACBETH,4,"Am I to fear, or none."
The Tragedy of Macbeth,5,7,YOUNG SIWARD,1,What is thy name?
The Tragedy of Macbeth,5,7,MACBETH,1,Thou'lt be afraid to hear it.
The Tragedy of Macbeth,5,7,YOUNG SIWARD,1,No; though thou call'st thyself a hotter name
The Tragedy of Macbeth,5,7,YOUNG SIWARD,2,Than any is in hell.
The Tragedy of Macbeth,5,7,MACBETH,1,My name's Macbeth.
The Tragedy of Macbeth,5,7,YOUNG SIWARD,1,The devil himself could not pronounce a title
The Tragedy of Macbeth,5,7,YOUNG SIWARD,2,More hateful to mine ear.
The Tragedy of Macbeth,5,7,MACBETH,1,"No, nor more fearful."
The Tragedy of Macbeth,5,7,YOUNG SIWARD,1,"Thou liest, abhorred tyrant; with my sword"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,5,7,YOUNG SIWARD,2,I'll prove the lie thou speak'st.
The Tragedy of Macbeth,5,7,MACBETH,1,Thou wast born of woman
The Tragedy of Macbeth,5,7,MACBETH,2,"But swords I smile at, weapons laugh to scorn,"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,5,7,MACBETH,3,Brandish'd by man that's of a woman born.
The Tragedy of Macbeth,5,7,MACDUFF,1,"That way the noise is. Tyrant, show thy face!"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,5,7,MACDUFF,2,"If thou be'st slain and with no stroke of mine,"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,5,7,MACDUFF,3,My wife and children's ghosts will haunt me still.
The Tragedy of Macbeth,5,7,MACDUFF,4,"I cannot strike at wretched kerns, whose arms"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,5,7,MACDUFF,5,"Are hired to bear their staves: either thou, Macbeth,"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,5,7,MACDUFF,6,Or else my sword with an unbatter'd edge
The Tragedy of Macbeth,5,7,MACDUFF,7,I sheathe again undeeded. There thou shouldst be;
The Tragedy of Macbeth,5,7,MACDUFF,8,"By this great clatter, one of greatest note"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,5,7,MACDUFF,9,"Seems bruited. Let me find him, fortune!"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,5,7,MACDUFF,10,And more I beg not.
The Tragedy of Macbeth,5,7,SIWARD,1,"This way, my lord; the castle's gently render'd:"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,5,7,SIWARD,2,The tyrant's people on both sides do fight;
The Tragedy of Macbeth,5,7,SIWARD,3,The noble thanes do bravely in the war;
The Tragedy of Macbeth,5,7,SIWARD,4,"The day almost itself professes yours,"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,5,7,SIWARD,5,And little is to do.
The Tragedy of Macbeth,5,7,MALCOLM,1,We have met with foes
The Tragedy of Macbeth,5,7,MALCOLM,2,That strike beside us.
The Tragedy of Macbeth,5,7,SIWARD,1,"Enter, sir, the castle."
The Tragedy of Macbeth,5,8,MACBETH,1,"Why should I play the Roman fool, and die"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,5,8,MACBETH,2,"On mine own sword? whiles I see lives, the gashes"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,5,8,MACBETH,3,Do better upon them.
The Tragedy of Macbeth,5,8,MACDUFF,1,"Turn, hell-hound, turn!"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,5,8,MACBETH,1,Of all men else I have avoided thee:
The Tragedy of Macbeth,5,8,MACBETH,2,But get thee back; my soul is too much charged
The Tragedy of Macbeth,5,8,MACBETH,3,With blood of thine already.
The Tragedy of Macbeth,5,8,MACDUFF,1,I have no words:
The Tragedy of Macbeth,5,8,MACDUFF,2,My voice is in my sword: thou bloodier villain
The Tragedy of Macbeth,5,8,MACDUFF,3,Than terms can give thee out!
The Tragedy of Macbeth,5,8,MACBETH,1,Thou losest labour:
The Tragedy of Macbeth,5,8,MACBETH,2,As easy mayst thou the intrenchant air
The Tragedy of Macbeth,5,8,MACBETH,3,With thy keen sword impress as make me bleed:
The Tragedy of Macbeth,5,8,MACBETH,4,Let fall thy blade on vulnerable crests;
The Tragedy of Macbeth,5,8,MACBETH,5,"I bear a charmed life, which must not yield,"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,5,8,MACBETH,6,To one of woman born.
The Tragedy of Macbeth,5,8,MACDUFF,1,Despair thy charm;
The Tragedy of Macbeth,5,8,MACDUFF,2,And let the angel whom thou still hast served
The Tragedy of Macbeth,5,8,MACDUFF,3,"Tell thee, Macduff was from his mother's womb"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,5,8,MACDUFF,4,Untimely ripp'd.
The Tragedy of Macbeth,5,8,MACBETH,1,"Accursed be that tongue that tells me so,"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,5,8,MACBETH,2,For it hath cow'd my better part of man!
The Tragedy of Macbeth,5,8,MACBETH,3,"And be these juggling fiends no more believed,"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,5,8,MACBETH,4,That palter with us in a double sense;
The Tragedy of Macbeth,5,8,MACBETH,5,"That keep the word of promise to our ear,"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,5,8,MACBETH,6,And break it to our hope. I'll not fight with thee.
The Tragedy of Macbeth,5,8,MACDUFF,1,"Then yield thee, coward,"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,5,8,MACDUFF,2,And live to be the show and gaze o' the time:
The Tragedy of Macbeth,5,8,MACDUFF,3,"We'll have thee, as our rarer monsters are,"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,5,8,MACDUFF,4,"Painted on a pole, and underwrit,"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,5,8,MACDUFF,5,'Here may you see the tyrant.'
The Tragedy of Macbeth,5,8,MACBETH,1,"I will not yield,"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,5,8,MACBETH,2,"To kiss the ground before young Malcolm's feet,"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,5,8,MACBETH,3,And to be baited with the rabble's curse.
The Tragedy of Macbeth,5,8,MACBETH,4,"Though Birnam wood be come to Dunsinane,"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,5,8,MACBETH,5,"And thou opposed, being of no woman born,"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,5,8,MACBETH,6,Yet I will try the last. Before my body
The Tragedy of Macbeth,5,8,MACBETH,7,"I throw my warlike shield. Lay on, Macduff,"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,5,8,MACBETH,8,"And damn'd be him that first cries, 'Hold, enough!'"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,5,8,MALCOLM,1,I would the friends we miss were safe arrived.
The Tragedy of Macbeth,5,8,SIWARD,1,"Some must go off: and yet, by these I see,"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,5,8,SIWARD,2,So great a day as this is cheaply bought.
The Tragedy of Macbeth,5,8,MALCOLM,1,"Macduff is missing, and your noble son."
The Tragedy of Macbeth,5,8,ROSS,1,"Your son, my lord, has paid a soldier's debt:"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,5,8,ROSS,2,He only lived but till he was a man;
The Tragedy of Macbeth,5,8,ROSS,3,The which no sooner had his prowess confirm'd
The Tragedy of Macbeth,5,8,ROSS,4,"In the unshrinking station where he fought,"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,5,8,ROSS,5,But like a man he died.
The Tragedy of Macbeth,5,8,SIWARD,1,Then he is dead?
The Tragedy of Macbeth,5,8,ROSS,1,"Ay, and brought off the field: your cause of sorrow"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,5,8,ROSS,2,"Must not be measured by his worth, for then"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,5,8,ROSS,3,It hath no end.
The Tragedy of Macbeth,5,8,SIWARD,1,Had he his hurts before?
The Tragedy of Macbeth,5,8,ROSS,1,"Ay, on the front."
The Tragedy of Macbeth,5,8,SIWARD,1,"Why then, God's soldier be he!"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,5,8,SIWARD,2,"Had I as many sons as I have hairs,"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,5,8,SIWARD,3,I would not wish them to a fairer death:
The Tragedy of Macbeth,5,8,SIWARD,4,"And so, his knell is knoll'd."
The Tragedy of Macbeth,5,8,MALCOLM,1,"He's worth more sorrow,"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,5,8,MALCOLM,2,And that I'll spend for him.
The Tragedy of Macbeth,5,8,SIWARD,1,He's worth no more
The Tragedy of Macbeth,5,8,SIWARD,2,"They say he parted well, and paid his score:"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,5,8,SIWARD,3,"And so, God be with him! Here comes newer comfort."
The Tragedy of Macbeth,5,8,MACDUFF,1,"Hail, king! for so thou art: behold, where stands"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,5,8,MACDUFF,2,The usurper's cursed head: the time is free:
The Tragedy of Macbeth,5,8,MACDUFF,3,"I see thee compass'd with thy kingdom's pearl,"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,5,8,MACDUFF,4,That speak my salutation in their minds;
The Tragedy of Macbeth,5,8,MACDUFF,5,Whose voices I desire aloud with mine:
The Tragedy of Macbeth,5,8,MACDUFF,6,"Hail, King of Scotland!"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,5,8,ALL,1,"Hail, King of Scotland!"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,5,8,MALCOLM,1,We shall not spend a large expense of time
The Tragedy of Macbeth,5,8,MALCOLM,2,"Before we reckon with your several loves,"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,5,8,MALCOLM,3,"And make us even with you. My thanes and kinsmen,"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,5,8,MALCOLM,4,"Henceforth be earls, the first that ever Scotland"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,5,8,MALCOLM,5,"In such an honour named. What's more to do,"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,5,8,MALCOLM,6,"Which would be planted newly with the time,"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,5,8,MALCOLM,7,As calling home our exiled friends abroad
The Tragedy of Macbeth,5,8,MALCOLM,8,That fled the snares of watchful tyranny;
The Tragedy of Macbeth,5,8,MALCOLM,9,Producing forth the cruel ministers
The Tragedy of Macbeth,5,8,MALCOLM,10,"Of this dead butcher and his fiend-like queen,"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,5,8,MALCOLM,11,"Who, as 'tis thought, by self and violent hands"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,5,8,MALCOLM,12,"Took off her life; this, and what needful else"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,5,8,MALCOLM,13,"That calls upon us, by the grace of Grace,"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,5,8,MALCOLM,14,"We will perform in measure, time and place:"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,5,8,MALCOLM,15,"So, thanks to all at once and to each one,"
The Tragedy of Macbeth,5,8,MALCOLM,16,Whom we invite to see us crown'd at Scone.
