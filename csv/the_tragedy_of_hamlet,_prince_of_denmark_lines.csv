"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",1,1,HORATIO,2,And let us hear Bernardo speak of this.
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",1,1,BERNARDO,1,"Last night of all,"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",1,1,BERNARDO,2,When yond same star that's westward from the pole
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",1,1,BERNARDO,3,Had made his course to illume that part of heaven
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",1,1,BERNARDO,4,"Where now it burns, Marcellus and myself,"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",1,1,BERNARDO,5,"The bell then beating one,--"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",1,1,MARCELLUS,1,"Peace, break thee off; look, where it comes again!"

"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",1,1,BERNARDO,1,"Looks it not like the king?  mark it, Horatio."
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",1,1,HORATIO,1,Most like: it harrows me with fear and wonder.
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",1,1,BERNARDO,1,It would be spoke to.
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",1,1,MARCELLUS,1,"Question it, Horatio."
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",1,1,HORATIO,1,"What art thou that usurp'st this time of night,"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",1,1,HORATIO,2,Together with that fair and warlike form
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",1,1,HORATIO,3,In which the majesty of buried Denmark
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",1,1,HORATIO,4,"Did sometimes march? by heaven I charge thee, speak!"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",1,1,MARCELLUS,1,It is offended.
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",1,1,BERNARDO,1,"See, it stalks away!"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",1,1,HORATIO,1,"Stay! speak, speak! I charge thee, speak!"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",1,1,MARCELLUS,1,"'Tis gone, and will not answer."
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",1,1,BERNARDO,1,"How now, Horatio! you tremble and look pale:"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",1,1,BERNARDO,2,Is not this something more than fantasy?
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",1,1,BERNARDO,3,What think you on't?
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",1,1,HORATIO,1,"Before my God, I might not this believe"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",1,1,HORATIO,2,Without the sensible and true avouch
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",1,1,HORATIO,3,Of mine own eyes.
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",1,1,MARCELLUS,1,Is it not like the king?
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",1,1,HORATIO,1,As thou art to thyself:
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",1,1,HORATIO,2,Such was the very armour he had on
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",1,1,HORATIO,3,When he the ambitious Norway combated;
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",1,1,HORATIO,4,"So frown'd he once, when, in an angry parle,"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",1,1,HORATIO,5,He smote the sledded Polacks on the ice.
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",1,1,HORATIO,6,'Tis strange.
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",1,1,MARCELLUS,1,"Thus twice before, and jump at this dead hour,"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",1,1,MARCELLUS,2,With martial stalk hath he gone by our watch.
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",1,1,HORATIO,1,In what particular thought to work I know not;
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",1,1,HORATIO,2,"But in the gross and scope of my opinion,"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",1,1,HORATIO,3,This bodes some strange eruption to our state.
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",1,1,MARCELLUS,1,"Good now, sit down, and tell me, he that knows,"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",1,1,MARCELLUS,2,Why this same strict and most observant watch
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",1,1,MARCELLUS,3,"So nightly toils the subject of the land,"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",1,1,MARCELLUS,4,"And why such daily cast of brazen cannon,"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",1,1,MARCELLUS,5,And foreign mart for implements of war;
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",1,1,MARCELLUS,6,"Why such impress of shipwrights, whose sore task"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",1,1,MARCELLUS,7,Does not divide the Sunday from the week;
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",1,1,MARCELLUS,8,"What might be toward, that this sweaty haste"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",1,1,MARCELLUS,9,Doth make the night joint-labourer with the day:
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",1,1,MARCELLUS,10,Who is't that can inform me?
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",1,1,HORATIO,1,That can I;
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",1,1,HORATIO,2,"At least, the whisper goes so. Our last king,"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",1,1,HORATIO,3,"Whose image even but now appear'd to us,"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",1,1,HORATIO,4,"Was, as you know, by Fortinbras of Norway,"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",1,1,HORATIO,5,"Thereto prick'd on by a most emulate pride,"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",1,1,HORATIO,6,Dared to the combat; in which our valiant Hamlet--
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",1,1,HORATIO,7,For so this side of our known world esteem'd him--
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",1,1,HORATIO,8,"Did slay this Fortinbras; who by a seal'd compact,"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",1,1,HORATIO,9,"Well ratified by law and heraldry,"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",1,1,HORATIO,10,"Did forfeit, with his life, all those his lands"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",1,1,HORATIO,11,"Which he stood seized of, to the conqueror:"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",1,1,HORATIO,12,"Against the which, a moiety competent"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",1,1,HORATIO,13,Was gaged by our king; which had return'd
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",1,1,HORATIO,14,"To the inheritance of Fortinbras,"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",1,1,HORATIO,15,"Had he been vanquisher; as, by the same covenant,"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",1,1,HORATIO,16,"And carriage of the article design'd,"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",1,1,HORATIO,17,"His fell to Hamlet. Now, sir, young Fortinbras,"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",1,1,HORATIO,18,"Of unimproved mettle hot and full,"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",1,1,HORATIO,19,Hath in the skirts of Norway here and there
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",1,1,HORATIO,20,"Shark'd up a list of lawless resolutes,"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",1,1,HORATIO,21,"For food and diet, to some enterprise"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",1,1,HORATIO,22,That hath a stomach in't; which is no other--
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",1,1,HORATIO,23,As it doth well appear unto our state--
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",1,1,HORATIO,24,"But to recover of us, by strong hand"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",1,1,HORATIO,25,"And terms compulsatory, those foresaid lands"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",1,1,HORATIO,26,"So by his father lost: and this, I take it,"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",1,1,HORATIO,27,"Is the main motive of our preparations,"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",1,1,HORATIO,28,The source of this our watch and the chief head
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",1,1,HORATIO,29,Of this post-haste and romage in the land.
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",1,1,BERNARDO,1,I think it be no other but e'en so:
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",1,1,BERNARDO,2,Well may it sort that this portentous figure
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",1,1,BERNARDO,3,Comes armed through our watch; so like the king
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",1,1,BERNARDO,4,That was and is the question of these wars.
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",1,1,HORATIO,1,A mote it is to trouble the mind's eye.
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",1,1,HORATIO,2,"In the most high and palmy state of Rome,"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",1,1,HORATIO,3,"A little ere the mightiest Julius fell,"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",1,1,HORATIO,4,The graves stood tenantless and the sheeted dead
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",1,1,HORATIO,5,Did squeak and gibber in the Roman streets:
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",1,1,HORATIO,6,"As stars with trains of fire and dews of blood,"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",1,1,HORATIO,7,Disasters in the sun; and the moist star
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",1,1,HORATIO,8,Upon whose influence Neptune's empire stands
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",1,1,HORATIO,9,Was sick almost to doomsday with eclipse:
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",1,1,HORATIO,10,"And even the like precurse of fierce events,"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",1,1,HORATIO,11,As harbingers preceding still the fates
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",1,1,HORATIO,12,"And prologue to the omen coming on,"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",1,1,HORATIO,13,Have heaven and earth together demonstrated
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",1,1,HORATIO,14,Unto our climatures and countrymen.--
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",1,1,HORATIO,15,"But soft, behold! lo, where it comes again!"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",1,1,HORATIO,16,"I'll cross it, though it blast me. Stay, illusion!"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",1,1,HORATIO,17,"If thou hast any sound, or use of voice,"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",1,1,HORATIO,18,Speak to me:
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",1,1,HORATIO,19,"If there be any good thing to be done,"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",1,1,HORATIO,20,"That may to thee do ease and grace to me,"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",1,1,HORATIO,21,Speak to me:
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",1,1,HORATIO,22,"If thou art privy to thy country's fate,"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",1,1,HORATIO,23,"Which, happily, foreknowing may avoid, O, speak!"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",1,1,HORATIO,24,Or if thou hast uphoarded in thy life
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",1,1,HORATIO,25,"Extorted treasure in the womb of earth,"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",1,1,HORATIO,26,"For which, they say, you spirits oft walk in death,"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",1,1,HORATIO,27,"Speak of it: stay, and speak! Stop it, Marcellus."
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",1,1,MARCELLUS,1,Shall I strike at it with my partisan?
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",1,1,HORATIO,1,"Do, if it will not stand."
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",1,1,BERNARDO,1,'Tis here!
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",1,1,HORATIO,1,'Tis here!
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",1,1,MARCELLUS,1,'Tis gone!
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",1,1,MARCELLUS,2,"We do it wrong, being so majestical,"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",1,1,MARCELLUS,3,To offer it the show of violence;
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",1,1,MARCELLUS,4,"For it is, as the air, invulnerable,"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",1,1,MARCELLUS,5,And our vain blows malicious mockery.
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",1,1,BERNARDO,1,"It was about to speak, when the cock crew."
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",1,1,HORATIO,1,And then it started like a guilty thing
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",1,1,HORATIO,2,"Upon a fearful summons. I have heard,"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",1,1,HORATIO,3,"The cock, that is the trumpet to the morn,"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",1,1,HORATIO,4,Doth with his lofty and shrill-sounding throat
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",1,1,HORATIO,5,"Awake the god of day; and, at his warning,"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",1,1,HORATIO,6,"Whether in sea or fire, in earth or air,"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",1,1,HORATIO,7,The extravagant and erring spirit hies
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",1,1,HORATIO,8,To his confine: and of the truth herein
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",1,1,HORATIO,9,This present object made probation.
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",1,1,MARCELLUS,1,It faded on the crowing of the cock.
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",1,1,MARCELLUS,2,Some say that ever 'gainst that season comes
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",1,1,MARCELLUS,3,"Wherein our Saviour's birth is celebrated,"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",1,1,MARCELLUS,4,The bird of dawning singeth all night long:
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",1,1,MARCELLUS,5,"And then, they say, no spirit dares stir abroad;"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",1,1,MARCELLUS,6,"The nights are wholesome; then no planets strike,"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",1,1,MARCELLUS,7,"No fairy takes, nor witch hath power to charm,"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",1,1,MARCELLUS,8,So hallow'd and so gracious is the time.
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",1,1,HORATIO,1,So have I heard and do in part believe it.
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",1,1,HORATIO,2,"But, look, the morn, in russet mantle clad,"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",1,1,HORATIO,3,Walks o'er the dew of yon high eastward hill:
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",1,1,HORATIO,4,"Break we our watch up; and by my advice,"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",1,1,HORATIO,5,Let us impart what we have seen to-night
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",1,1,HORATIO,6,"Unto young Hamlet; for, upon my life,"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",1,1,HORATIO,7,"This spirit, dumb to us, will speak to him."
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",1,1,HORATIO,8,"Do you consent we shall acquaint him with it,"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",1,1,HORATIO,9,"As needful in our loves, fitting our duty?"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",1,1,MARCELLUS,1,"Let's do't, I pray; and I this morning know"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",1,1,MARCELLUS,2,Where we shall find him most conveniently.

"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",1,2,KING CLAUDIUS,12,"With mirth in funeral and with dirge in marriage,"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",1,2,KING CLAUDIUS,13,"In equal scale weighing delight and dole,--"

"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",1,2,KING CLAUDIUS,18,"Holding a weak supposal of our worth,"

"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",1,2,HAMLET,1,"Ay, madam, it is common."
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",1,2,QUEEN GERTRUDE,1,"If it be,"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",1,2,QUEEN GERTRUDE,2,Why seems it so particular with thee?
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",1,2,HAMLET,1,"Seems, madam! nay it is; I know not 'seems.'"

"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",1,2,KING CLAUDIUS,13,"As any the most vulgar thing to sense,"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",1,2,KING CLAUDIUS,14,Why should we in our peevish opposition

"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",1,2,KING CLAUDIUS,16,"A fault against the dead, a fault to nature,"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",1,2,KING CLAUDIUS,17,To reason most absurd: whose common theme

"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",1,2,HAMLET,31,"But break, my heart; for I must hold my tongue."
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",1,2,HORATIO,1,Hail to your lordship!
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",1,2,HAMLET,1,I am glad to see you well:
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",1,2,HAMLET,2,"Horatio,--or I do forget myself."
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",1,2,HORATIO,1,"The same, my lord, and your poor servant ever."
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",1,2,HAMLET,1,"Sir, my good friend; I'll change that name with you:"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",1,2,HAMLET,2,"And what make you from Wittenberg, Horatio? Marcellus?"

"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",1,2,HAMLET,1,"I am very glad to see you. Good even, sir."
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",1,2,HAMLET,2,"But what, in faith, make you from Wittenberg?"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",1,2,HORATIO,1,"A truant disposition, good my lord."
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",1,2,HAMLET,1,"I would not hear your enemy say so,"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",1,2,HAMLET,2,"Nor shall you do mine ear that violence,"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",1,2,HAMLET,3,To make it truster of your own report
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",1,2,HAMLET,4,Against yourself: I know you are no truant.
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",1,2,HAMLET,5,But what is your affair in Elsinore?
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",1,2,HAMLET,6,We'll teach you to drink deep ere you depart.
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",1,2,HORATIO,1,"My lord, I came to see your father's funeral."
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",1,2,HAMLET,1,"I pray thee, do not mock me, fellow-student;"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",1,2,HAMLET,2,I think it was to see my mother's wedding.
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",1,2,HORATIO,1,"Indeed, my lord, it follow'd hard upon."
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",1,2,HAMLET,1,"Thrift, thrift, Horatio! the funeral baked meats"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",1,2,HAMLET,2,Did coldly furnish forth the marriage tables.
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",1,2,HAMLET,3,Would I had met my dearest foe in heaven
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",1,2,HAMLET,4,"Or ever I had seen that day, Horatio!"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",1,2,HAMLET,5,My father!--methinks I see my father.
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",1,2,HORATIO,1,"Where, my lord?"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",1,2,HAMLET,1,"In my mind's eye, Horatio."
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",1,2,HORATIO,1,I saw him once; he was a goodly king.
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",1,2,HAMLET,1,"He was a man, take him for all in all,"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",1,2,HAMLET,2,I shall not look upon his like again.
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",1,2,HORATIO,1,"My lord, I think I saw him yesternight."
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",1,2,HAMLET,1,Saw? who?
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",1,2,HORATIO,1,"My lord, the king your father."
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",1,2,HAMLET,1,The king my father!
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",1,2,HORATIO,1,Season your admiration for awhile
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",1,2,HORATIO,2,"With an attent ear, till I may deliver,"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",1,2,HORATIO,3,"Upon the witness of these gentlemen,"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",1,2,HORATIO,4,This marvel to you.
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",1,2,HAMLET,1,"For God's love, let me hear."
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",1,2,HORATIO,1,"Two nights together had these gentlemen,"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",1,2,HORATIO,2,"Marcellus and Bernardo, on their watch,"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",1,2,HORATIO,3,"In the dead vast and middle of the night,"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",1,2,HORATIO,4,"Been thus encounter'd. A figure like your father,"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",1,2,HORATIO,5,"Armed at point exactly, cap-a-pe,"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",1,2,HORATIO,6,"Appears before them, and with solemn march"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",1,2,HORATIO,7,Goes slow and stately by them: thrice he walk'd
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",1,2,HORATIO,8,"By their oppress'd and fear-surprised eyes,"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",1,2,HORATIO,9,"Within his truncheon's length; whilst they, distilled"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",1,2,HORATIO,10,"Almost to jelly with the act of fear,"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",1,2,HORATIO,11,Stand dumb and speak not to him. This to me
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",1,2,HORATIO,12,In dreadful secrecy impart they did;
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",1,2,HORATIO,13,And I with them the third night kept the watch;
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",1,2,HORATIO,14,"Where, as they had deliver'd, both in time,"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",1,2,HORATIO,15,"Form of the thing, each word made true and good,"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",1,2,HORATIO,16,The apparition comes: I knew your father;
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",1,2,HORATIO,17,These hands are not more like.
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",1,2,HAMLET,1,But where was this?
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",1,2,MARCELLUS,1,"My lord, upon the platform where we watch'd."
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",1,2,HAMLET,1,Did you not speak to it?
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",1,2,HORATIO,1,"My lord, I did;"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",1,2,HORATIO,2,But answer made it none: yet once methought
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",1,2,HORATIO,3,It lifted up its head and did address
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",1,2,HORATIO,4,"Itself to motion, like as it would speak;"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",1,2,HORATIO,5,"But even then the morning cock crew loud,"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",1,2,HORATIO,6,"And at the sound it shrunk in haste away,"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",1,2,HORATIO,7,And vanish'd from our sight.
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",1,2,HAMLET,1,'Tis very strange.
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",1,2,HORATIO,1,"As I do live, my honour'd lord, 'tis true;"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",1,2,HORATIO,2,And we did think it writ down in our duty
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",1,2,HORATIO,3,To let you know of it.
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",1,2,HAMLET,1,"Indeed, indeed, sirs, but this troubles me."
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",1,2,HAMLET,2,Hold you the watch to-night?
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",1,2,MARCELLUS,1,"We do, my lord."
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",1,2,BERNARDO,1,"We do, my lord."
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",1,2,HAMLET,1,"Arm'd, say you?"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",1,2,MARCELLUS,1,"Arm'd, my lord."
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",1,2,BERNARDO,1,"Arm'd, my lord."
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",1,2,HAMLET,1,From top to toe?
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",1,2,MARCELLUS,1,"My lord, from head to foot."
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",1,2,BERNARDO,1,"My lord, from head to foot."
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",1,2,HAMLET,1,Then saw you not his face?
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",1,2,HORATIO,1,"O, yes, my lord; he wore his beaver up."
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",1,2,HAMLET,1,"What, look'd he frowningly?"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",1,2,HORATIO,1,A countenance more in sorrow than in anger.
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",1,2,HAMLET,1,Pale or red?
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",1,2,HORATIO,1,"Nay, very pale."
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",1,2,HAMLET,1,And fix'd his eyes upon you?
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",1,2,HORATIO,1,Most constantly.
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",1,2,HAMLET,1,I would I had been there.
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",1,2,HORATIO,1,It would have much amazed you.
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",1,2,HAMLET,1,"Very like, very like. Stay'd it long?"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",1,2,HORATIO,1,While one with moderate haste might tell a hundred.
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",1,2,MARCELLUS,1,"Longer, longer."
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",1,2,BERNARDO,1,"Longer, longer."
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",1,2,HORATIO,1,Not when I saw't.
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",1,2,HAMLET,1,His beard was grizzled--no?
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",1,2,HORATIO,1,"It was, as I have seen it in his life,"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",1,2,HORATIO,2,A sable silver'd.
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",1,2,HAMLET,1,I will watch to-night;
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",1,2,HAMLET,2,Perchance 'twill walk again.
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",1,2,HORATIO,1,I warrant it will.
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",1,2,HAMLET,1,"If it assume my noble father's person,"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",1,2,HAMLET,2,"I'll speak to it, though hell itself should gape"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",1,2,HAMLET,3,"And bid me hold my peace. I pray you all,"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",1,2,HAMLET,4,"If you have hitherto conceal'd this sight,"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",1,2,HAMLET,5,Let it be tenable in your silence still;
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",1,2,HAMLET,6,"And whatsoever else shall hap to-night,"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",1,2,HAMLET,7,"Give it an understanding, but no tongue:"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",1,2,HAMLET,8,"I will requite your loves. So, fare you well:"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",1,2,HAMLET,9,"Upon the platform, 'twixt eleven and twelve,"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",1,2,HAMLET,10,I'll visit you.
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",1,2,ALL,1,Our duty to your honour.
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",1,2,HAMLET,1,"Your loves, as mine to you: farewell."
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",1,2,HAMLET,2,My father's spirit in arms! all is not well;
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",1,2,HAMLET,3,I doubt some foul play: would the night were come!
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",1,2,HAMLET,4,"Till then sit still, my soul: foul deeds will rise,"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",1,2,HAMLET,5,"Though all the earth o'erwhelm them, to men's eyes."
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",1,3,LAERTES,1,My necessaries are embark'd: farewell:
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",1,3,LAERTES,2,"And, sister, as the winds give benefit"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",1,3,LAERTES,3,"And convoy is assistant, do not sleep,"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",1,3,LAERTES,4,But let me hear from you.
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",1,3,OPHELIA,1,Do you doubt that?
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",1,3,LAERTES,1,"For Hamlet and the trifling of his favour,"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",1,3,LAERTES,2,"Hold it a fashion and a toy in blood,"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",1,3,LAERTES,3,"A violet in the youth of primy nature,"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",1,3,LAERTES,4,"Forward, not permanent, sweet, not lasting,"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",1,3,LAERTES,5,The perfume and suppliance of a minute; No more.
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",1,3,OPHELIA,1,No more but so?
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",1,3,LAERTES,1,Think it no more;
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",1,3,LAERTES,2,"For nature, crescent, does not grow alone"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",1,3,LAERTES,3,"In thews and bulk, but, as this temple waxes,"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",1,3,LAERTES,4,The inward service of the mind and soul
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",1,3,LAERTES,5,"Grows wide withal. Perhaps he loves you now,"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",1,3,LAERTES,6,And now no soil nor cautel doth besmirch
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",1,3,LAERTES,7,"The virtue of his will: but you must fear,"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",1,3,LAERTES,8,"His greatness weigh'd, his will is not his own;"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",1,3,LAERTES,9,For he himself is subject to his birth:
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",1,3,LAERTES,10,"He may not, as unvalued persons do,"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",1,3,LAERTES,11,Carve for himself; for on his choice depends
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",1,3,LAERTES,12,The safety and health of this whole state;
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",1,3,LAERTES,13,And therefore must his choice be circumscribed
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",1,3,LAERTES,14,Unto the voice and yielding of that body
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",1,3,LAERTES,15,"Whereof he is the head. Then if he says he loves you,"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",1,3,LAERTES,16,It fits your wisdom so far to believe it
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",1,3,LAERTES,17,As he in his particular act and place
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",1,3,LAERTES,18,May give his saying deed; which is no further
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",1,3,LAERTES,19,Than the main voice of Denmark goes withal.
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",1,3,LAERTES,20,"Then weigh what loss your honour may sustain,"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",1,3,LAERTES,21,"If with too credent ear you list his songs,"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",1,3,LAERTES,22,"Or lose your heart, or your chaste treasure open"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",1,3,LAERTES,23,To his unmaster'd importunity.
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",1,3,LAERTES,24,"Fear it, Ophelia, fear it, my dear sister,"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",1,3,LAERTES,25,"And keep you in the rear of your affection,"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",1,3,LAERTES,26,Out of the shot and danger of desire.
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",1,3,LAERTES,27,"The chariest maid is prodigal enough,"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",1,3,LAERTES,28,If she unmask her beauty to the moon:
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",1,3,LAERTES,29,Virtue itself 'scapes not calumnious strokes:
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",1,3,LAERTES,30,"The canker galls the infants of the spring,"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",1,3,LAERTES,31,"Too oft before their buttons be disclosed,"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",1,3,LAERTES,32,And in the morn and liquid dew of youth
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",1,3,LAERTES,33,Contagious blastments are most imminent.
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",1,3,LAERTES,34,Be wary then; best safety lies in fear:
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",1,3,LAERTES,35,"Youth to itself rebels, though none else near."
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",1,3,OPHELIA,1,"I shall the effect of this good lesson keep,"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",1,3,OPHELIA,2,"As watchman to my heart. But, good my brother,"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",1,3,OPHELIA,3,"Do not, as some ungracious pastors do,"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",1,3,OPHELIA,4,Show me the steep and thorny way to heaven;
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",1,3,OPHELIA,5,"Whiles, like a puff'd and reckless libertine,"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",1,3,OPHELIA,6,"Himself the primrose path of dalliance treads,"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",1,3,OPHELIA,7,And recks not his own rede.
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",1,3,LAERTES,1,"O, fear me not."

"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",1,3,LORD POLONIUS,4,And these few precepts in thy memory
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",1,3,LORD POLONIUS,5,"See thou character. Give thy thoughts no tongue,"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",1,3,LORD POLONIUS,6,Nor any unproportioned thought his act.
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",1,3,LORD POLONIUS,7,"Be thou familiar, but by no means vulgar."
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",1,3,LORD POLONIUS,8,"Those friends thou hast, and their adoption tried,"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",1,3,LORD POLONIUS,9,Grapple them to thy soul with hoops of steel;

"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",1,3,LORD POLONIUS,11,"Of each new-hatch'd, unfledged comrade. Beware"

"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",1,3,LORD POLONIUS,21,Neither a borrower nor a lender be;
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",1,3,LORD POLONIUS,22,"For loan oft loses both itself and friend,"

"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",1,3,OPHELIA,1,"So please you, something touching the Lord Hamlet."
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",1,3,LORD POLONIUS,1,"Marry, well bethought:"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",1,3,LORD POLONIUS,2,"'Tis told me, he hath very oft of late"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",1,3,LORD POLONIUS,3,Given private time to you; and you yourself
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",1,3,LORD POLONIUS,4,Have of your audience been most free and bounteous:
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",1,3,LORD POLONIUS,5,"If it be so, as so 'tis put on me,"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",1,3,LORD POLONIUS,6,"And that in way of caution, I must tell you,"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",1,3,LORD POLONIUS,7,You do not understand yourself so clearly
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",1,3,LORD POLONIUS,8,As it behoves my daughter and your honour.
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",1,3,LORD POLONIUS,9,What is between you? give me up the truth.
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",1,3,OPHELIA,1,"He hath, my lord, of late made many tenders"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",1,3,OPHELIA,2,Of his affection to me.
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",1,3,LORD POLONIUS,1,"Affection! pooh! you speak like a green girl,"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",1,3,LORD POLONIUS,2,Unsifted in such perilous circumstance.
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",1,3,LORD POLONIUS,3,"Do you believe his tenders, as you call them?"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",1,3,OPHELIA,1,"I do not know, my lord, what I should think."
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",1,3,LORD POLONIUS,1,"Marry, I'll teach you: think yourself a baby;"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",1,3,LORD POLONIUS,2,"That you have ta'en these tenders for true pay,"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",1,3,LORD POLONIUS,3,Which are not sterling. Tender yourself more dearly;
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",1,3,LORD POLONIUS,4,"Or--not to crack the wind of the poor phrase,"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",1,3,LORD POLONIUS,5,Running it thus--you'll tender me a fool.
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",1,3,OPHELIA,1,"My lord, he hath importuned me with love"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",1,3,OPHELIA,2,In honourable fashion.
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",1,3,LORD POLONIUS,1,"Ay, fashion you may call it; go to, go to."
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",1,3,OPHELIA,1,"And hath given countenance to his speech, my lord,"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",1,3,OPHELIA,2,With almost all the holy vows of heaven.
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",1,3,LORD POLONIUS,1,"Ay, springes to catch woodcocks. I do know,"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",1,3,LORD POLONIUS,2,"When the blood burns, how prodigal the soul"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",1,3,LORD POLONIUS,3,"Lends the tongue vows: these blazes, daughter,"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",1,3,LORD POLONIUS,4,"Giving more light than heat, extinct in both,"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",1,3,LORD POLONIUS,5,"Even in their promise, as it is a-making,"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",1,3,LORD POLONIUS,6,You must not take for fire. From this time
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",1,3,LORD POLONIUS,7,Be somewhat scanter of your maiden presence;
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",1,3,LORD POLONIUS,8,Set your entreatments at a higher rate
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",1,3,LORD POLONIUS,9,"Than a command to parley. For Lord Hamlet,"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",1,3,LORD POLONIUS,10,"Believe so much in him, that he is young"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",1,3,LORD POLONIUS,11,And with a larger tether may he walk
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",1,3,LORD POLONIUS,12,"Than may be given you: in few, Ophelia,"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",1,3,LORD POLONIUS,13,"Do not believe his vows; for they are brokers,"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",1,3,LORD POLONIUS,14,"Not of that dye which their investments show,"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",1,3,LORD POLONIUS,15,"But mere implorators of unholy suits,"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",1,3,LORD POLONIUS,16,"Breathing like sanctified and pious bawds,"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",1,3,LORD POLONIUS,17,The better to beguile. This is for all:
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",1,3,LORD POLONIUS,18,"I would not, in plain terms, from this time forth,"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",1,3,LORD POLONIUS,19,"Have you so slander any moment leisure,"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",1,3,LORD POLONIUS,20,As to give words or talk with the Lord Hamlet.
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",1,3,LORD POLONIUS,21,"Look to't, I charge you: come your ways."
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",1,3,OPHELIA,1,"I shall obey, my lord."
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",1,4,HAMLET,1,The air bites shrewdly; it is very cold.
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",1,4,HORATIO,1,It is a nipping and an eager air.
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",1,4,HAMLET,1,What hour now?
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",1,4,HORATIO,1,I think it lacks of twelve.
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",1,4,HAMLET,1,"No, it is struck."
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",1,4,HORATIO,1,Indeed? I heard it not: then it draws near the season
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",1,4,HORATIO,2,Wherein the spirit held his wont to walk.
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",1,4,HORATIO,3,"What does this mean, my lord?"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",1,4,HAMLET,1,"The king doth wake to-night and takes his rouse,"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",1,4,HAMLET,2,"Keeps wassail, and the swaggering up-spring reels;"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",1,4,HAMLET,3,"And, as he drains his draughts of Rhenish down,"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",1,4,HAMLET,4,The kettle-drum and trumpet thus bray out
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",1,4,HAMLET,5,The triumph of his pledge.
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",1,4,HORATIO,1,Is it a custom?
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",1,4,HAMLET,1,"Ay, marry, is't:"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",1,4,HAMLET,2,"But to my mind, though I am native here"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",1,4,HAMLET,3,"And to the manner born, it is a custom"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",1,4,HAMLET,4,More honour'd in the breach than the observance.
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",1,4,HAMLET,5,This heavy-headed revel east and west
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",1,4,HAMLET,6,Makes us traduced and tax'd of other nations:
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",1,4,HAMLET,7,"They clepe us drunkards, and with swinish phrase"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",1,4,HAMLET,8,Soil our addition; and indeed it takes
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",1,4,HAMLET,9,"From our achievements, though perform'd at height,"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",1,4,HAMLET,10,The pith and marrow of our attribute.
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",1,4,HAMLET,11,"So, oft it chances in particular men,"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",1,4,HAMLET,12,"That for some vicious mole of nature in them,"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",1,4,HAMLET,13,"As, in their birth--wherein they are not guilty,"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",1,4,HAMLET,14,Since nature cannot choose his origin--
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",1,4,HAMLET,15,"By the o'ergrowth of some complexion,"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",1,4,HAMLET,16,"Oft breaking down the pales and forts of reason,"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",1,4,HAMLET,17,Or by some habit that too much o'er-leavens
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",1,4,HAMLET,18,"The form of plausive manners, that these men,"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",1,4,HAMLET,19,"Carrying, I say, the stamp of one defect,"

"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",1,4,HAMLET,6,"That I will speak to thee: I'll call thee Hamlet,"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",1,4,HAMLET,7,"King, father, royal Dane: O, answer me!"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",1,4,HAMLET,8,Let me not burst in ignorance; but tell
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",1,4,HAMLET,9,"Why thy canonized bones, hearsed in death,"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",1,4,HAMLET,10,"Have burst their cerements; why the sepulchre,"

"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",1,4,HAMLET,15,"Revisit'st thus the glimpses of the moon,"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",1,4,HAMLET,16,Making night hideous; and we fools of nature
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",1,4,HAMLET,17,So horridly to shake our disposition
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",1,4,HAMLET,18,With thoughts beyond the reaches of our souls?
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",1,4,HAMLET,19,"Say, why is this? wherefore? what should we do?"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",1,4,HORATIO,1,"It beckons you to go away with it,"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",1,4,HORATIO,2,As if it some impartment did desire
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",1,4,HORATIO,3,To you alone.
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",1,4,MARCELLUS,1,"Look, with what courteous action"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",1,4,MARCELLUS,2,It waves you to a more removed ground:
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",1,4,MARCELLUS,3,But do not go with it.
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",1,4,HORATIO,1,"No, by no means."
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",1,4,HAMLET,1,It will not speak; then I will follow it.
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",1,4,HORATIO,1,"Do not, my lord."
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",1,4,HAMLET,1,"Why, what should be the fear?"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",1,4,HAMLET,2,I do not set my life in a pin's fee;
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",1,4,HAMLET,3,"And for my soul, what can it do to that,"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",1,4,HAMLET,4,Being a thing immortal as itself?
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",1,4,HAMLET,5,It waves me forth again: I'll follow it.
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",1,4,HORATIO,1,"What if it tempt you toward the flood, my lord,"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",1,4,HORATIO,2,Or to the dreadful summit of the cliff
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",1,4,HORATIO,3,"That beetles o'er his base into the sea,"

"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",1,4,HORATIO,8,"Without more motive, into every brain"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",1,4,HORATIO,9,That looks so many fathoms to the sea
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",1,4,HORATIO,10,And hears it roar beneath.
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",1,4,HAMLET,1,It waves me still.
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",1,4,HAMLET,2,Go on; I'll follow thee.
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",1,4,MARCELLUS,1,"You shall not go, my lord."
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",1,4,HAMLET,1,Hold off your hands.

"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",1,4,HAMLET,1,"My fate cries out,"

"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",1,4,HORATIO,1,He waxes desperate with imagination.
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",1,4,MARCELLUS,1,Let's follow; 'tis not fit thus to obey him.
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",1,4,HORATIO,1,Have after. To what issue will this come?
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",1,4,MARCELLUS,1,Something is rotten in the state of Denmark.
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",1,4,HORATIO,1,Heaven will direct it.
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",1,4,MARCELLUS,1,"Nay, let's follow him."
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",1,5,HAMLET,1,Where wilt thou lead me? speak; I'll go no further.
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",1,5,GHOST,1,Mark me.
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",1,5,HAMLET,1,I will.
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",1,5,GHOST,1,"My hour is almost come,"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",1,5,GHOST,2,When I to sulphurous and tormenting flames
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",1,5,GHOST,3,Must render up myself.
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",1,5,HAMLET,1,"Alas, poor ghost!"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",1,5,GHOST,1,"Pity me not, but lend thy serious hearing"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",1,5,GHOST,2,To what I shall unfold.
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",1,5,HAMLET,1,Speak; I am bound to hear.
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",1,5,GHOST,1,"So art thou to revenge, when thou shalt hear."
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",1,5,HAMLET,1,What?
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",1,5,GHOST,1,"I am thy father's spirit,"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",1,5,GHOST,2,"Doom'd for a certain term to walk the night,"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",1,5,GHOST,3,"And for the day confined to fast in fires,"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",1,5,GHOST,4,Till the foul crimes done in my days of nature
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",1,5,GHOST,5,Are burnt and purged away. But that I am forbid
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",1,5,GHOST,6,"To tell the secrets of my prison-house,"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",1,5,GHOST,7,I could a tale unfold whose lightest word
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",1,5,GHOST,8,"Would harrow up thy soul, freeze thy young blood,"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",1,5,GHOST,9,"Make thy two eyes, like stars, start from their spheres,"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",1,5,GHOST,10,Thy knotted and combined locks to part
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",1,5,GHOST,11,"And each particular hair to stand on end,"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",1,5,GHOST,12,Like quills upon the fretful porpentine:
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",1,5,GHOST,13,But this eternal blazon must not be
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",1,5,GHOST,14,"To ears of flesh and blood. List, list, O, list!"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",1,5,GHOST,15,If thou didst ever thy dear father love--
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",1,5,HAMLET,1,O God!
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",1,5,GHOST,1,Revenge his foul and most unnatural murder.
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",1,5,HAMLET,1,Murder!
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",1,5,GHOST,1,"Murder most foul, as in the best it is;"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",1,5,GHOST,2,"But this most foul, strange and unnatural."
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",1,5,HAMLET,1,"Haste me to know't, that I, with wings as swift"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",1,5,HAMLET,2,"As meditation or the thoughts of love,"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",1,5,HAMLET,3,May sweep to my revenge.
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",1,5,GHOST,1,I find thee apt;
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",1,5,GHOST,2,And duller shouldst thou be than the fat weed
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",1,5,GHOST,3,"That roots itself in ease on Lethe wharf,"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",1,5,GHOST,4,"Wouldst thou not stir in this. Now, Hamlet, hear:"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",1,5,GHOST,5,"'Tis given out that, sleeping in my orchard,"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",1,5,GHOST,6,A serpent stung me; so the whole ear of Denmark
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",1,5,GHOST,7,Is by a forged process of my death
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",1,5,GHOST,8,"Rankly abused: but know, thou noble youth,"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",1,5,GHOST,9,The serpent that did sting thy father's life
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",1,5,GHOST,10,Now wears his crown.
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",1,5,HAMLET,1,O my prophetic soul! My uncle!
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",1,5,GHOST,1,"Ay, that incestuous, that adulterate beast,"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",1,5,GHOST,2,"With witchcraft of his wit, with traitorous gifts,--"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",1,5,GHOST,3,"O wicked wit and gifts, that have the power"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",1,5,GHOST,4,So to seduce!--won to his shameful lust
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",1,5,GHOST,5,The will of my most seeming-virtuous queen:
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",1,5,GHOST,6,"O Hamlet, what a falling-off was there!"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",1,5,GHOST,7,"From me, whose love was of that dignity"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",1,5,GHOST,8,That it went hand in hand even with the vow
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",1,5,GHOST,9,"I made to her in marriage, and to decline"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",1,5,GHOST,10,Upon a wretch whose natural gifts were poor
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",1,5,GHOST,11,To those of mine!
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",1,5,GHOST,12,"But virtue, as it never will be moved,"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",1,5,GHOST,13,"Though lewdness court it in a shape of heaven,"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",1,5,GHOST,14,"So lust, though to a radiant angel link'd,"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",1,5,GHOST,15,"Will sate itself in a celestial bed,"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",1,5,GHOST,16,And prey on garbage.
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",1,5,GHOST,17,"But, soft! methinks I scent the morning air;"

"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",1,5,HAMLET,17,"That one may smile, and smile, and be a villain;"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",1,5,HAMLET,18,At least I'm sure it may be so in Denmark:

"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",1,5,HAMLET,10,"Or by pronouncing of some doubtful phrase,"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",1,5,HAMLET,11,"As 'Well, well, we know,' or 'We could, an if we would,'"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",1,5,HAMLET,12,"Or 'If we list to speak,' or 'There be, an if they might,'"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",1,5,HAMLET,13,"Or such ambiguous giving out, to note"

"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",2,1,LORD POLONIUS,2,"Before you visit him, to make inquire"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",2,1,LORD POLONIUS,3,Of his behavior.
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",2,1,REYNALDO,1,"My lord, I did intend it."
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",2,1,LORD POLONIUS,1,"Marry, well said; very well said. Look you, sir,"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",2,1,LORD POLONIUS,2,Inquire me first what Danskers are in Paris;

"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",2,1,LORD POLONIUS,4,"What company, at what expense; and finding"

"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",2,1,LORD POLONIUS,6,"That they do know my son, come you more nearer"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",2,1,LORD POLONIUS,7,Than your particular demands will touch it:
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",2,1,LORD POLONIUS,8,"Take you, as 'twere, some distant knowledge of him;"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",2,1,LORD POLONIUS,9,"As thus, 'I know his father and his friends,"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",2,1,LORD POLONIUS,10,"And in part him: ' do you mark this, Reynaldo?"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",2,1,REYNALDO,1,"Ay, very well, my lord."
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",2,1,LORD POLONIUS,1,'And in part him; but' you may say 'not well:
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",2,1,LORD POLONIUS,2,"But, if't be he I mean, he's very wild;"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",2,1,LORD POLONIUS,3,Addicted so and so:' and there put on him
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",2,1,LORD POLONIUS,4,"What forgeries you please; marry, none so rank"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",2,1,LORD POLONIUS,5,As may dishonour him; take heed of that;
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",2,1,LORD POLONIUS,6,"But, sir, such wanton, wild and usual slips"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",2,1,LORD POLONIUS,7,As are companions noted and most known

"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",2,1,LORD POLONIUS,2,"You must not put another scandal on him,"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",2,1,LORD POLONIUS,3,That he is open to incontinency;
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",2,1,LORD POLONIUS,4,That's not my meaning: but breathe his faults so quaintly
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",2,1,LORD POLONIUS,5,"That they may seem the taints of liberty,"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",2,1,LORD POLONIUS,6,"The flash and outbreak of a fiery mind,"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",2,1,LORD POLONIUS,7,"A savageness in unreclaimed blood,"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",2,1,LORD POLONIUS,8,Of general assault.
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",2,1,REYNALDO,1,"But, my good lord,--"

"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",2,1,REYNALDO,1,"Ay, my lord,"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",2,1,REYNALDO,2,I would know that.
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",2,1,LORD POLONIUS,1,"Marry, sir, here's my drift;"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",2,1,LORD POLONIUS,2,"And I believe, it is a fetch of wit:"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",2,1,LORD POLONIUS,3,"You laying these slight sullies on my son,"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",2,1,LORD POLONIUS,4,"As 'twere a thing a little soil'd i' the working, Mark you,"

"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",2,1,REYNALDO,1,"At 'closes in the consequence,' at 'friend or so,'"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",2,1,REYNALDO,2,and 'gentleman.'
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",2,1,LORD POLONIUS,1,"At 'closes in the consequence,' ay, marry;"

"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",2,1,LORD POLONIUS,1,Farewell!
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",2,1,LORD POLONIUS,2,"How now, Ophelia! what's the matter?"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",2,1,OPHELIA,1,"O, my lord, my lord, I have been so affrighted!"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",2,1,LORD POLONIUS,1,"With what, i' the name of God?"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",2,1,OPHELIA,1,"My lord, as I was sewing in my closet,"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",2,1,OPHELIA,2,"Lord Hamlet, with his doublet all unbraced;"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",2,1,OPHELIA,3,"No hat upon his head; his stockings foul'd,"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",2,1,OPHELIA,4,"Ungarter'd, and down-gyved to his ancle;"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",2,1,OPHELIA,5,Pale as his shirt; his knees knocking each other;
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",2,1,OPHELIA,6,And with a look so piteous in purport
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",2,1,OPHELIA,7,As if he had been loosed out of hell
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",2,1,OPHELIA,8,"To speak of horrors,--he comes before me."
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",2,1,LORD POLONIUS,1,Mad for thy love?
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",2,1,OPHELIA,1,"My lord, I do not know;"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",2,1,OPHELIA,2,"But truly, I do fear it."
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",2,1,LORD POLONIUS,1,What said he?
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",2,1,OPHELIA,1,He took me by the wrist and held me hard;
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",2,1,OPHELIA,2,Then goes he to the length of all his arm;
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",2,1,OPHELIA,3,"And, with his other hand thus o'er his brow,"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",2,1,OPHELIA,4,He falls to such perusal of my face
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",2,1,OPHELIA,5,As he would draw it. Long stay'd he so;
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",2,1,OPHELIA,6,"At last, a little shaking of mine arm"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",2,1,OPHELIA,7,"And thrice his head thus waving up and down,"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",2,1,OPHELIA,8,He raised a sigh so piteous and profound
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",2,1,OPHELIA,9,As it did seem to shatter all his bulk
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",2,1,OPHELIA,10,"And end his being: that done, he lets me go:"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",2,1,OPHELIA,11,"And, with his head over his shoulder turn'd,"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",2,1,OPHELIA,12,He seem'd to find his way without his eyes;
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",2,1,OPHELIA,13,"For out o' doors he went without their helps,"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",2,1,OPHELIA,14,"And, to the last, bended their light on me."
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",2,1,LORD POLONIUS,1,"Come, go with me: I will go seek the king."
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",2,1,LORD POLONIUS,2,"This is the very ecstasy of love,"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",2,1,LORD POLONIUS,3,Whose violent property fordoes itself
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",2,1,LORD POLONIUS,4,And leads the will to desperate undertakings
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",2,1,LORD POLONIUS,5,As oft as any passion under heaven
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",2,1,LORD POLONIUS,6,That does afflict our natures. I am sorry.
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",2,1,LORD POLONIUS,7,"What, have you given him any hard words of late?"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",2,1,OPHELIA,1,"No, my good lord, but, as you did command,"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",2,1,OPHELIA,2,I did repel his fetters and denied
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",2,1,OPHELIA,3,His access to me.
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",2,1,LORD POLONIUS,1,That hath made him mad.
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",2,1,LORD POLONIUS,2,I am sorry that with better heed and judgment
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",2,1,LORD POLONIUS,3,"I had not quoted him: I fear'd he did but trifle,"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",2,1,LORD POLONIUS,4,"And meant to wreck thee; but, beshrew my jealousy!"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",2,1,LORD POLONIUS,5,"By heaven, it is as proper to our age"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",2,1,LORD POLONIUS,6,To cast beyond ourselves in our opinions
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",2,1,LORD POLONIUS,7,As it is common for the younger sort
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",2,1,LORD POLONIUS,8,"To lack discretion. Come, go we to the king:"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",2,1,LORD POLONIUS,9,"This must be known; which, being kept close, might"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",2,1,LORD POLONIUS,10,move
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",2,1,LORD POLONIUS,11,More grief to hide than hate to utter love.
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",2,2,KING CLAUDIUS,1,"Welcome, dear Rosencrantz and Guildenstern!"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",2,2,KING CLAUDIUS,2,"Moreover that we much did long to see you,"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",2,2,KING CLAUDIUS,3,The need we have to use you did provoke
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",2,2,KING CLAUDIUS,4,Our hasty sending. Something have you heard
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",2,2,KING CLAUDIUS,5,"Of Hamlet's transformation; so call it,"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",2,2,KING CLAUDIUS,6,Sith nor the exterior nor the inward man
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",2,2,KING CLAUDIUS,7,"Resembles that it was. What it should be,"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",2,2,KING CLAUDIUS,8,"More than his father's death, that thus hath put him"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",2,2,KING CLAUDIUS,9,"So much from the understanding of himself,"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",2,2,KING CLAUDIUS,10,"I cannot dream of: I entreat you both,"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",2,2,KING CLAUDIUS,11,"That, being of so young days brought up with him,"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",2,2,KING CLAUDIUS,12,"And sith so neighbour'd to his youth and havior,"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",2,2,KING CLAUDIUS,13,That you vouchsafe your rest here in our court
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",2,2,KING CLAUDIUS,14,Some little time: so by your companies
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",2,2,KING CLAUDIUS,15,"To draw him on to pleasures, and to gather,"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",2,2,KING CLAUDIUS,16,"So much as from occasion you may glean,"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",2,2,KING CLAUDIUS,17,"Whether aught, to us unknown, afflicts him thus,"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",2,2,KING CLAUDIUS,18,"That, open'd, lies within our remedy."
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",2,2,QUEEN GERTRUDE,1,"Good gentlemen, he hath much talk'd of you;"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",2,2,QUEEN GERTRUDE,2,And sure I am two men there are not living
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",2,2,QUEEN GERTRUDE,3,To whom he more adheres. If it will please you
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",2,2,QUEEN GERTRUDE,4,To show us so much gentry and good will
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",2,2,QUEEN GERTRUDE,5,"As to expend your time with us awhile,"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",2,2,QUEEN GERTRUDE,6,"For the supply and profit of our hope,"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",2,2,QUEEN GERTRUDE,7,Your visitation shall receive such thanks
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",2,2,QUEEN GERTRUDE,8,As fits a king's remembrance.
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",2,2,ROSENCRANTZ,1,Both your majesties
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",2,2,ROSENCRANTZ,2,"Might, by the sovereign power you have of us,"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",2,2,ROSENCRANTZ,3,Put your dread pleasures more into command
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",2,2,ROSENCRANTZ,4,Than to entreaty.
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",2,2,GUILDENSTERN,1,"But we both obey,"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",2,2,GUILDENSTERN,2,"And here give up ourselves, in the full bent"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",2,2,GUILDENSTERN,3,"To lay our service freely at your feet,"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",2,2,GUILDENSTERN,4,To be commanded.
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",2,2,KING CLAUDIUS,1,"Thanks, Rosencrantz and gentle Guildenstern."
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",2,2,QUEEN GERTRUDE,1,"Thanks, Guildenstern and gentle Rosencrantz:"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",2,2,QUEEN GERTRUDE,2,And I beseech you instantly to visit
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",2,2,QUEEN GERTRUDE,3,"My too much changed son. Go, some of you,"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",2,2,QUEEN GERTRUDE,4,And bring these gentlemen where Hamlet is.
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",2,2,GUILDENSTERN,1,Heavens make our presence and our practises
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",2,2,GUILDENSTERN,2,Pleasant and helpful to him!
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",2,2,QUEEN GERTRUDE,1,"Ay, amen!"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",2,2,LORD POLONIUS,1,"The ambassadors from Norway, my good lord,"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",2,2,LORD POLONIUS,2,Are joyfully return'd.
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",2,2,KING CLAUDIUS,1,Thou still hast been the father of good news.
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",2,2,LORD POLONIUS,1,"Have I, my lord? I assure my good liege,"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",2,2,LORD POLONIUS,2,"I hold my duty, as I hold my soul,"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",2,2,LORD POLONIUS,3,Both to my God and to my gracious king:
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",2,2,LORD POLONIUS,4,"And I do think, or else this brain of mine"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",2,2,LORD POLONIUS,5,Hunts not the trail of policy so sure
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",2,2,LORD POLONIUS,6,"As it hath used to do, that I have found"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",2,2,LORD POLONIUS,7,The very cause of Hamlet's lunacy.
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",2,2,KING CLAUDIUS,1,"O, speak of that; that do I long to hear."
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",2,2,LORD POLONIUS,1,Give first admittance to the ambassadors;
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",2,2,LORD POLONIUS,2,My news shall be the fruit to that great feast.
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",2,2,KING CLAUDIUS,1,"Thyself do grace to them, and bring them in."
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",2,2,KING CLAUDIUS,2,"He tells me, my dear Gertrude, he hath found"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",2,2,KING CLAUDIUS,3,The head and source of all your son's distemper.
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",2,2,QUEEN GERTRUDE,1,I doubt it is no other but the main;
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",2,2,QUEEN GERTRUDE,2,"His father's death, and our o'erhasty marriage."
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",2,2,KING CLAUDIUS,1,"Well, we shall sift him."
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",2,2,KING CLAUDIUS,2,"Welcome, my good friends!"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",2,2,KING CLAUDIUS,3,"Say, Voltimand, what from our brother Norway?"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",2,2,VOLTIMAND,1,Most fair return of greetings and desires.
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",2,2,VOLTIMAND,2,"Upon our first, he sent out to suppress"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",2,2,VOLTIMAND,3,His nephew's levies; which to him appear'd
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",2,2,VOLTIMAND,4,To be a preparation 'gainst the Polack;
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",2,2,VOLTIMAND,5,"But, better look'd into, he truly found"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",2,2,VOLTIMAND,6,"It was against your highness: whereat grieved,"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",2,2,VOLTIMAND,7,"That so his sickness, age and impotence"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",2,2,VOLTIMAND,8,"Was falsely borne in hand, sends out arrests"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",2,2,VOLTIMAND,9,"On Fortinbras; which he, in brief, obeys;"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",2,2,VOLTIMAND,10,"Receives rebuke from Norway, and in fine"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",2,2,VOLTIMAND,11,Makes vow before his uncle never more
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",2,2,VOLTIMAND,12,To give the assay of arms against your majesty.
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",2,2,VOLTIMAND,13,"Whereon old Norway, overcome with joy,"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",2,2,VOLTIMAND,14,"Gives him three thousand crowns in annual fee,"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",2,2,VOLTIMAND,15,"And his commission to employ those soldiers,"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",2,2,VOLTIMAND,16,"So levied as before, against the Polack:"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",2,2,VOLTIMAND,17,"With an entreaty, herein further shown,"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",2,2,VOLTIMAND,18,That it might please you to give quiet pass
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",2,2,VOLTIMAND,19,"Through your dominions for this enterprise,"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",2,2,VOLTIMAND,20,On such regards of safety and allowance
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",2,2,VOLTIMAND,21,As therein are set down.
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",2,2,KING CLAUDIUS,1,It likes us well;
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",2,2,KING CLAUDIUS,2,"And at our more consider'd time well read,"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",2,2,KING CLAUDIUS,3,"Answer, and think upon this business."
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",2,2,KING CLAUDIUS,4,Meantime we thank you for your well-took labour:
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",2,2,KING CLAUDIUS,5,Go to your rest; at night we'll feast together:
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",2,2,KING CLAUDIUS,6,Most welcome home!
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",2,2,LORD POLONIUS,1,This business is well ended.
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",2,2,LORD POLONIUS,2,"My liege, and madam, to expostulate"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",2,2,LORD POLONIUS,3,"What majesty should be, what duty is,"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",2,2,LORD POLONIUS,4,"Why day is day, night night, and time is time,"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",2,2,LORD POLONIUS,5,"Were nothing but to waste night, day and time."
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",2,2,LORD POLONIUS,6,"Therefore, since brevity is the soul of wit,"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",2,2,LORD POLONIUS,7,"And tediousness the limbs and outward flourishes,"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",2,2,LORD POLONIUS,8,I will be brief: your noble son is mad:
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",2,2,LORD POLONIUS,9,"Mad call I it; for, to define true madness,"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",2,2,LORD POLONIUS,10,What is't but to be nothing else but mad?
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",2,2,LORD POLONIUS,11,But let that go.
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",2,2,QUEEN GERTRUDE,1,"More matter, with less art."
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",2,2,LORD POLONIUS,1,"Madam, I swear I use no art at all."
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",2,2,LORD POLONIUS,2,"That he is mad, 'tis true: 'tis true 'tis pity;"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",2,2,LORD POLONIUS,3,And pity 'tis 'tis true: a foolish figure;
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",2,2,LORD POLONIUS,4,"But farewell it, for I will use no art."
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",2,2,LORD POLONIUS,5,"Mad let us grant him, then: and now remains"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",2,2,LORD POLONIUS,6,"That we find out the cause of this effect,"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",2,2,LORD POLONIUS,7,"Or rather say, the cause of this defect,"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",2,2,LORD POLONIUS,8,For this effect defective comes by cause:
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",2,2,LORD POLONIUS,9,"Thus it remains, and the remainder thus. Perpend."
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",2,2,LORD POLONIUS,10,I have a daughter--have while she is mine--
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",2,2,LORD POLONIUS,11,"Who, in her duty and obedience, mark,"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",2,2,LORD POLONIUS,12,"Hath given me this: now gather, and surmise."
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",2,2,LORD POLONIUS,13,"'To the celestial and my soul's idol, the most"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",2,2,LORD POLONIUS,14,"beautified Ophelia,'--"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",2,2,LORD POLONIUS,15,"That's an ill phrase, a vile phrase; 'beautified' is"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",2,2,LORD POLONIUS,16,a vile phrase: but you shall hear. Thus:
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",2,2,LORD POLONIUS,17,"'In her excellent white bosom, these, &c.'"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",2,2,QUEEN GERTRUDE,1,Came this from Hamlet to her?
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",2,2,LORD POLONIUS,1,"Good madam, stay awhile; I will be faithful."
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",2,2,LORD POLONIUS,2,'Doubt thou the stars are fire;
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",2,2,LORD POLONIUS,3,Doubt that the sun doth move;
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",2,2,LORD POLONIUS,4,Doubt truth to be a liar;
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",2,2,LORD POLONIUS,5,But never doubt I love.
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",2,2,LORD POLONIUS,6,"'O dear Ophelia, I am ill at these numbers;"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",2,2,LORD POLONIUS,7,I have not art to reckon my groans: but that
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",2,2,LORD POLONIUS,8,"I love thee best, O most best, believe it. Adieu."
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",2,2,LORD POLONIUS,9,"'Thine evermore most dear lady, whilst"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",2,2,LORD POLONIUS,10,"this machine is to him, HAMLET.'"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",2,2,LORD POLONIUS,11,"This, in obedience, hath my daughter shown me,"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",2,2,LORD POLONIUS,12,"And more above, hath his solicitings,"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",2,2,LORD POLONIUS,13,"As they fell out by time, by means and place,"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",2,2,LORD POLONIUS,14,All given to mine ear.
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",2,2,KING CLAUDIUS,1,But how hath she
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",2,2,KING CLAUDIUS,2,Received his love?
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",2,2,LORD POLONIUS,1,What do you think of me?
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",2,2,KING CLAUDIUS,1,As of a man faithful and honourable.
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",2,2,LORD POLONIUS,1,"I would fain prove so. But what might you think,"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",2,2,LORD POLONIUS,2,When I had seen this hot love on the wing--
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",2,2,LORD POLONIUS,3,"As I perceived it, I must tell you that,"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",2,2,LORD POLONIUS,4,"Before my daughter told me--what might you,"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",2,2,LORD POLONIUS,5,"Or my dear majesty your queen here, think,"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",2,2,LORD POLONIUS,6,"If I had play'd the desk or table-book,"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",2,2,LORD POLONIUS,7,"Or given my heart a winking, mute and dumb,"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",2,2,LORD POLONIUS,8,Or look'd upon this love with idle sight;
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",2,2,LORD POLONIUS,9,"What might you think? No, I went round to work,"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",2,2,LORD POLONIUS,10,And my young mistress thus I did bespeak:
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",2,2,LORD POLONIUS,11,"'Lord Hamlet is a prince, out of thy star;"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",2,2,LORD POLONIUS,12,"This must not be:' and then I precepts gave her,"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",2,2,LORD POLONIUS,13,"That she should lock herself from his resort,"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",2,2,LORD POLONIUS,14,"Admit no messengers, receive no tokens."
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",2,2,LORD POLONIUS,15,"Which done, she took the fruits of my advice;"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",2,2,LORD POLONIUS,16,"And he, repulsed--a short tale to make--"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",2,2,LORD POLONIUS,17,"Fell into a sadness, then into a fast,"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",2,2,LORD POLONIUS,18,"Thence to a watch, thence into a weakness,"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",2,2,LORD POLONIUS,19,"Thence to a lightness, and, by this declension,"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",2,2,LORD POLONIUS,20,"Into the madness wherein now he raves,"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",2,2,LORD POLONIUS,21,And all we mourn for.
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",2,2,KING CLAUDIUS,1,Do you think 'tis this?
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",2,2,QUEEN GERTRUDE,1,"It may be, very likely."
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",2,2,LORD POLONIUS,1,Hath there been such a time--I'd fain know that--
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",2,2,LORD POLONIUS,2,"That I have positively said 'Tis so,'"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",2,2,LORD POLONIUS,3,When it proved otherwise?
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",2,2,KING CLAUDIUS,1,Not that I know.
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",2,2,LORD POLONIUS,1,"Take this from this, if this be otherwise:"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",2,2,LORD POLONIUS,2,"If circumstances lead me, I will find"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",2,2,LORD POLONIUS,3,"Where truth is hid, though it were hid indeed"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",2,2,LORD POLONIUS,4,Within the centre.
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",2,2,KING CLAUDIUS,1,How may we try it further?
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",2,2,LORD POLONIUS,1,"You know, sometimes he walks four hours together"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",2,2,LORD POLONIUS,2,Here in the lobby.
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",2,2,QUEEN GERTRUDE,1,So he does indeed.
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",2,2,LORD POLONIUS,1,At such a time I'll loose my daughter to him:
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",2,2,LORD POLONIUS,2,Be you and I behind an arras then;
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",2,2,LORD POLONIUS,3,Mark the encounter: if he love her not
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",2,2,LORD POLONIUS,4,"And be not from his reason fall'n thereon,"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",2,2,LORD POLONIUS,5,"Let me be no assistant for a state,"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",2,2,LORD POLONIUS,6,But keep a farm and carters.
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",2,2,KING CLAUDIUS,1,We will try it.
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",2,2,QUEEN GERTRUDE,1,"But, look, where sadly the poor wretch comes reading."
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",2,2,LORD POLONIUS,1,"Away, I do beseech you, both away:"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",2,2,LORD POLONIUS,2,I'll board him presently.
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",2,2,LORD POLONIUS,3,"O, give me leave:"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",2,2,LORD POLONIUS,4,How does my good Lord Hamlet?
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",2,2,HAMLET,1,"Well, God-a-mercy."
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",2,2,LORD POLONIUS,1,"Do you know me, my lord?"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",2,2,HAMLET,1,Excellent well; you are a fishmonger.
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",2,2,LORD POLONIUS,1,"Not I, my lord."
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",2,2,HAMLET,1,Then I would you were so honest a man.
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",2,2,LORD POLONIUS,1,"Honest, my lord!"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",2,2,HAMLET,1,"Ay, sir; to be honest, as this world goes, is to be"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",2,2,HAMLET,2,one man picked out of ten thousand.
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",2,2,LORD POLONIUS,1,"That's very true, my lord."
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",2,2,HAMLET,1,"For if the sun breed maggots in a dead dog, being a"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",2,2,HAMLET,2,"god kissing carrion,--Have you a daughter?"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",2,2,LORD POLONIUS,1,"I have, my lord."
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",2,2,HAMLET,1,Let her not walk i' the sun: conception is a
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",2,2,HAMLET,2,blessing: but not as your daughter may conceive.
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",2,2,HAMLET,3,"Friend, look to 't."
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",2,2,LORD POLONIUS,1,daughter: yet he knew me not at first; he said I
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",2,2,LORD POLONIUS,2,"was a fishmonger: he is far gone, far gone: and"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",2,2,LORD POLONIUS,3,truly in my youth I suffered much extremity for
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",2,2,LORD POLONIUS,4,love; very near this. I'll speak to him again.
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",2,2,LORD POLONIUS,5,"What do you read, my lord?"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",2,2,HAMLET,1,"Words, words, words."
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",2,2,LORD POLONIUS,1,"What is the matter, my lord?"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",2,2,HAMLET,1,Between who?
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",2,2,LORD POLONIUS,1,"I mean, the matter that you read, my lord."
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",2,2,HAMLET,1,"Slanders, sir: for the satirical rogue says here"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",2,2,HAMLET,2,"that old men have grey beards, that their faces are"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",2,2,HAMLET,3,"wrinkled, their eyes purging thick amber and"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",2,2,HAMLET,4,plum-tree gum and that they have a plentiful lack of
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",2,2,HAMLET,5,"wit, together with most weak hams: all which, sir,"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",2,2,HAMLET,6,"though I most powerfully and potently believe, yet"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",2,2,HAMLET,7,"I hold it not honesty to have it thus set down, for"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",2,2,HAMLET,8,"yourself, sir, should be old as I am, if like a crab"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",2,2,HAMLET,9,you could go backward.
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",2,2,LORD POLONIUS,1,"in 't. Will you walk out of the air, my lord?"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",2,2,HAMLET,1,Into my grave.
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",2,2,LORD POLONIUS,1,"Indeed, that is out o' the air."
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",2,2,LORD POLONIUS,2,How pregnant sometimes his replies are! a happiness
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",2,2,LORD POLONIUS,3,"that often madness hits on, which reason and sanity"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",2,2,LORD POLONIUS,4,could not so prosperously be delivered of. I will
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",2,2,LORD POLONIUS,5,"leave him, and suddenly contrive the means of"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",2,2,LORD POLONIUS,6,meeting between him and my daughter.--My honourable
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",2,2,LORD POLONIUS,7,"lord, I will most humbly take my leave of you."
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",2,2,HAMLET,1,"You cannot, sir, take from me any thing that I will"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",2,2,HAMLET,2,"more willingly part withal: except my life, except"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",2,2,HAMLET,3,"my life, except my life."
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",2,2,LORD POLONIUS,1,"Fare you well, my lord."
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",2,2,HAMLET,1,These tedious old fools!
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",2,2,LORD POLONIUS,1,You go to seek the Lord Hamlet; there he is.
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",2,2,GUILDENSTERN,1,My honoured lord!
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",2,2,ROSENCRANTZ,1,My most dear lord!
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",2,2,HAMLET,1,"My excellent good friends! How dost thou,"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",2,2,HAMLET,2,"Guildenstern? Ah, Rosencrantz! Good lads, how do ye both?"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",2,2,ROSENCRANTZ,1,As the indifferent children of the earth.
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",2,2,GUILDENSTERN,1,"Happy, in that we are not over-happy;"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",2,2,GUILDENSTERN,2,On fortune's cap we are not the very button.
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",2,2,HAMLET,1,Nor the soles of her shoe?
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",2,2,ROSENCRANTZ,1,"Neither, my lord."
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",2,2,HAMLET,1,"Then you live about her waist, or in the middle of"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",2,2,HAMLET,2,her favours?
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",2,2,GUILDENSTERN,1,"'Faith, her privates we."
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",2,2,HAMLET,1,"In the secret parts of fortune? O, most true; she"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",2,2,HAMLET,2,is a strumpet. What's the news?
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",2,2,ROSENCRANTZ,1,"None, my lord, but that the world's grown honest."
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",2,2,HAMLET,1,Then is doomsday near: but your news is not true.
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",2,2,HAMLET,2,"Let me question more in particular: what have you,"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",2,2,HAMLET,3,"my good friends, deserved at the hands of fortune,"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",2,2,HAMLET,4,that she sends you to prison hither?
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",2,2,GUILDENSTERN,1,"Prison, my lord!"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",2,2,HAMLET,1,Denmark's a prison.
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",2,2,ROSENCRANTZ,1,Then is the world one.
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",2,2,HAMLET,1,"A goodly one; in which there are many confines,"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",2,2,HAMLET,2,"wards and dungeons, Denmark being one o' the worst."
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",2,2,ROSENCRANTZ,1,"We think not so, my lord."
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",2,2,HAMLET,1,"Why, then, 'tis none to you; for there is nothing"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",2,2,HAMLET,2,"either good or bad, but thinking makes it so: to me"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",2,2,HAMLET,3,it is a prison.
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",2,2,ROSENCRANTZ,1,"Why then, your ambition makes it one; 'tis too"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",2,2,ROSENCRANTZ,2,narrow for your mind.
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",2,2,HAMLET,1,"O God, I could be bounded in a nut shell and count"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",2,2,HAMLET,2,"myself a king of infinite space, were it not that I"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",2,2,HAMLET,3,have bad dreams.
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",2,2,GUILDENSTERN,1,"Which dreams indeed are ambition, for the very"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",2,2,GUILDENSTERN,2,substance of the ambitious is merely the shadow of a dream.
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",2,2,HAMLET,1,A dream itself is but a shadow.
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",2,2,ROSENCRANTZ,1,"Truly, and I hold ambition of so airy and light a"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",2,2,ROSENCRANTZ,2,quality that it is but a shadow's shadow.
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",2,2,HAMLET,1,"Then are our beggars bodies, and our monarchs and"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",2,2,HAMLET,2,outstretched heroes the beggars' shadows. Shall we
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",2,2,HAMLET,3,"to the court? for, by my fay, I cannot reason."
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",2,2,ROSENCRANTZ,1,We'll wait upon you.
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",2,2,GUILDENSTERN,1,We'll wait upon you.
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",2,2,HAMLET,1,No such matter: I will not sort you with the rest
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",2,2,HAMLET,2,"of my servants, for, to speak to you like an honest"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",2,2,HAMLET,3,"man, I am most dreadfully attended. But, in the"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",2,2,HAMLET,4,"beaten way of friendship, what make you at Elsinore?"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",2,2,ROSENCRANTZ,1,"To visit you, my lord; no other occasion."
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",2,2,HAMLET,1,"Beggar that I am, I am even poor in thanks; but I"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",2,2,HAMLET,2,"thank you: and sure, dear friends, my thanks are"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",2,2,HAMLET,3,too dear a halfpenny. Were you not sent for? Is it
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",2,2,HAMLET,4,"your own inclining? Is it a free visitation? Come,"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",2,2,HAMLET,5,"deal justly with me: come, come; nay, speak."
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",2,2,GUILDENSTERN,1,"What should we say, my lord?"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",2,2,HAMLET,1,"Why, any thing, but to the purpose. You were sent"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",2,2,HAMLET,2,for; and there is a kind of confession in your looks
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",2,2,HAMLET,3,which your modesties have not craft enough to colour:
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",2,2,HAMLET,4,I know the good king and queen have sent for you.
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",2,2,ROSENCRANTZ,1,"To what end, my lord?"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",2,2,HAMLET,1,"That you must teach me. But let me conjure you, by"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",2,2,HAMLET,2,"the rights of our fellowship, by the consonancy of"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",2,2,HAMLET,3,"our youth, by the obligation of our ever-preserved"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",2,2,HAMLET,4,"love, and by what more dear a better proposer could"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",2,2,HAMLET,5,"charge you withal, be even and direct with me,"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",2,2,HAMLET,6,"whether you were sent for, or no?"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",2,2,HAMLET,1,"love me, hold not off."
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",2,2,GUILDENSTERN,1,"My lord, we were sent for."
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",2,2,HAMLET,1,I will tell you why; so shall my anticipation
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",2,2,HAMLET,2,"prevent your discovery, and your secrecy to the king"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",2,2,HAMLET,3,and queen moult no feather. I have of late--but
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",2,2,HAMLET,4,"wherefore I know not--lost all my mirth, forgone all"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",2,2,HAMLET,5,custom of exercises; and indeed it goes so heavily
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",2,2,HAMLET,6,"with my disposition that this goodly frame, the"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",2,2,HAMLET,7,"earth, seems to me a sterile promontory, this most"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",2,2,HAMLET,8,"excellent canopy, the air, look you, this brave"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",2,2,HAMLET,9,"o'erhanging firmament, this majestical roof fretted"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",2,2,HAMLET,10,"with golden fire, why, it appears no other thing to"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",2,2,HAMLET,11,me than a foul and pestilent congregation of vapours.
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",2,2,HAMLET,12,What a piece of work is a man! how noble in reason!
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",2,2,HAMLET,13,how infinite in faculty! in form and moving how
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",2,2,HAMLET,14,express and admirable! in action how like an angel!
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",2,2,HAMLET,15,in apprehension how like a god! the beauty of the
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",2,2,HAMLET,16,"world! the paragon of animals! And yet, to me,"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",2,2,HAMLET,17,what is this quintessence of dust? man delights not
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",2,2,HAMLET,18,"me: no, nor woman neither, though by your smiling"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",2,2,HAMLET,19,you seem to say so.
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",2,2,ROSENCRANTZ,1,"My lord, there was no such stuff in my thoughts."
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",2,2,HAMLET,1,"Why did you laugh then, when I said 'man delights not me'?"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",2,2,ROSENCRANTZ,1,"To think, my lord, if you delight not in man, what"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",2,2,ROSENCRANTZ,2,lenten entertainment the players shall receive from
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",2,2,ROSENCRANTZ,3,you: we coted them on the way; and hither are they
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",2,2,ROSENCRANTZ,4,"coming, to offer you service."
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",2,2,HAMLET,1,He that plays the king shall be welcome; his majesty
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",2,2,HAMLET,2,shall have tribute of me; the adventurous knight
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",2,2,HAMLET,3,shall use his foil and target; the lover shall not
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",2,2,HAMLET,4,sigh gratis; the humourous man shall end his part
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",2,2,HAMLET,5,in peace; the clown shall make those laugh whose
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",2,2,HAMLET,6,lungs are tickled o' the sere; and the lady shall
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",2,2,HAMLET,7,"say her mind freely, or the blank verse shall halt"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",2,2,HAMLET,8,for't. What players are they?
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",2,2,ROSENCRANTZ,1,"Even those you were wont to take delight in, the"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",2,2,ROSENCRANTZ,2,tragedians of the city.
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",2,2,HAMLET,1,"How chances it they travel? their residence, both"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",2,2,HAMLET,2,"in reputation and profit, was better both ways."
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",2,2,ROSENCRANTZ,1,I think their inhibition comes by the means of the
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",2,2,ROSENCRANTZ,2,late innovation.
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",2,2,HAMLET,1,Do they hold the same estimation they did when I was
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",2,2,HAMLET,2,in the city? are they so followed?
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",2,2,ROSENCRANTZ,1,"No, indeed, are they not."
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",2,2,HAMLET,1,How comes it? do they grow rusty?
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",2,2,ROSENCRANTZ,1,"Nay, their endeavour keeps in the wonted pace: but"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",2,2,ROSENCRANTZ,2,"there is, sir, an aery of children, little eyases,"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",2,2,ROSENCRANTZ,3,"that cry out on the top of question, and are most"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",2,2,ROSENCRANTZ,4,tyrannically clapped for't: these are now the
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",2,2,ROSENCRANTZ,5,"fashion, and so berattle the common stages--so they"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",2,2,ROSENCRANTZ,6,call them--that many wearing rapiers are afraid of
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",2,2,ROSENCRANTZ,7,goose-quills and dare scarce come thither.
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",2,2,HAMLET,1,"What, are they children? who maintains 'em? how are"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",2,2,HAMLET,2,they escoted? Will they pursue the quality no
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",2,2,HAMLET,3,longer than they can sing? will they not say
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",2,2,HAMLET,4,"afterwards, if they should grow themselves to common"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",2,2,HAMLET,5,"players--as it is most like, if their means are no"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",2,2,HAMLET,6,"better--their writers do them wrong, to make them"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",2,2,HAMLET,7,exclaim against their own succession?
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",2,2,ROSENCRANTZ,1,"'Faith, there has been much to do on both sides; and"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",2,2,ROSENCRANTZ,2,the nation holds it no sin to tarre them to
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",2,2,ROSENCRANTZ,3,"controversy: there was, for a while, no money bid"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",2,2,ROSENCRANTZ,4,"for argument, unless the poet and the player went to"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",2,2,ROSENCRANTZ,5,cuffs in the question.
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",2,2,HAMLET,1,Is't possible?
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",2,2,GUILDENSTERN,1,"O, there has been much throwing about of brains."
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",2,2,HAMLET,1,Do the boys carry it away?
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",2,2,ROSENCRANTZ,1,"Ay, that they do, my lord; Hercules and his load too."
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",2,2,HAMLET,1,It is not very strange; for mine uncle is king of
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",2,2,HAMLET,2,"Denmark, and those that would make mows at him while"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",2,2,HAMLET,3,"my father lived, give twenty, forty, fifty, an"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",2,2,HAMLET,4,hundred ducats a-piece for his picture in little.
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",2,2,HAMLET,5,"'Sblood, there is something in this more than"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",2,2,HAMLET,6,"natural, if philosophy could find it out."
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",2,2,GUILDENSTERN,1,There are the players.
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",2,2,HAMLET,1,"Gentlemen, you are welcome to Elsinore. Your hands,"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",2,2,HAMLET,2,come then: the appurtenance of welcome is fashion
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",2,2,HAMLET,3,"and ceremony: let me comply with you in this garb,"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",2,2,HAMLET,4,"lest my extent to the players, which, I tell you,"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",2,2,HAMLET,5,"must show fairly outward, should more appear like"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",2,2,HAMLET,6,entertainment than yours. You are welcome: but my
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",2,2,HAMLET,7,uncle-father and aunt-mother are deceived.
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",2,2,GUILDENSTERN,1,"In what, my dear lord?"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",2,2,HAMLET,1,I am but mad north-north-west: when the wind is
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",2,2,HAMLET,2,southerly I know a hawk from a handsaw.
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",2,2,LORD POLONIUS,1,"Well be with you, gentlemen!"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",2,2,HAMLET,1,"Hark you, Guildenstern; and you too: at each ear a"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",2,2,HAMLET,2,hearer: that great baby you see there is not yet

"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",2,2,ROSENCRANTZ,1,Happily he's the second time come to them; for they

"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",2,2,HAMLET,1,I will prophesy he comes to tell me of the players;
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",2,2,HAMLET,2,"mark it. You say right, sir: o' Monday morning;"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",2,2,HAMLET,3,'twas so indeed.
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",2,2,LORD POLONIUS,1,"My lord, I have news to tell you."
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",2,2,HAMLET,1,"My lord, I have news to tell you."
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",2,2,HAMLET,2,"When Roscius was an actor in Rome,--"

"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",3,1,ROSENCRANTZ,1,He does confess he feels himself distracted;
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",3,1,ROSENCRANTZ,2,But from what cause he will by no means speak.
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",3,1,GUILDENSTERN,1,"Nor do we find him forward to be sounded,"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",3,1,GUILDENSTERN,2,"But, with a crafty madness, keeps aloof,"

"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",3,1,QUEEN GERTRUDE,1,Did he receive you well?
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",3,1,ROSENCRANTZ,1,Most like a gentleman.
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",3,1,GUILDENSTERN,1,But with much forcing of his disposition.
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",3,1,ROSENCRANTZ,1,"Niggard of question; but, of our demands,"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",3,1,ROSENCRANTZ,2,Most free in his reply.
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",3,1,QUEEN GERTRUDE,1,Did you assay him?
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",3,1,QUEEN GERTRUDE,2,To any pastime?
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",3,1,ROSENCRANTZ,1,"Madam, it so fell out, that certain players"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",3,1,ROSENCRANTZ,2,We o'er-raught on the way: of these we told him;
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",3,1,ROSENCRANTZ,3,And there did seem in him a kind of joy
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",3,1,ROSENCRANTZ,4,"To hear of it: they are about the court,"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",3,1,ROSENCRANTZ,5,"And, as I think, they have already order"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",3,1,ROSENCRANTZ,6,This night to play before him.
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",3,1,LORD POLONIUS,1,'Tis most true:

"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",3,1,KING CLAUDIUS,3,"Good gentlemen, give him a further edge,"

"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",3,1,KING CLAUDIUS,2,"The harlot's cheek, beautied with plastering art,"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",3,1,KING CLAUDIUS,3,Is not more ugly to the thing that helps it

"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",3,1,KING CLAUDIUS,5,O heavy burthen!
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",3,1,LORD POLONIUS,1,"I hear him coming: let's withdraw, my lord."
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",3,1,HAMLET,1,"To be, or not to be: that is the question:"

"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",3,1,HAMLET,10,"To sleep: perchance to dream: ay, there's the rub;"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",3,1,HAMLET,11,For in that sleep of death what dreams may come
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",3,1,HAMLET,12,"When we have shuffled off this mortal coil,"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",3,1,HAMLET,13,Must give us pause: there's the respect

"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",3,1,HAMLET,15,"For who would bear the whips and scorns of time,"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",3,1,HAMLET,16,"The oppressor's wrong, the proud man's contumely,"

"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",3,1,HAMLET,28,Thus conscience does make cowards of us all;

"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",3,1,HAMLET,30,"Is sicklied o'er with the pale cast of thought,"

"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",3,1,HAMLET,1,"No, not I;"

"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",3,1,HAMLET,1,"Ay, truly; for the power of beauty will sooner"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",3,1,HAMLET,2,transform honesty from what it is to a bawd than the
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",3,1,HAMLET,3,force of honesty can translate beauty into his

"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",3,2,HAMLET,2,me! You would play upon me; you would seem to know
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",3,2,HAMLET,3,my stops; you would pluck out the heart of my
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",3,2,HAMLET,4,mystery; you would sound me from my lowest note to

"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",3,3,KING CLAUDIUS,7,"And, like a man to double business bound,"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",3,3,KING CLAUDIUS,8,"I stand in pause where I shall first begin,"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",3,3,KING CLAUDIUS,9,And both neglect. What if this cursed hand
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",3,3,KING CLAUDIUS,10,"Were thicker than itself with brother's blood,"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",3,3,KING CLAUDIUS,11,Is there not rain enough in the sweet heavens
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",3,3,KING CLAUDIUS,12,To wash it white as snow? Whereto serves mercy
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",3,3,KING CLAUDIUS,13,But to confront the visage of offence?
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",3,3,KING CLAUDIUS,14,"And what's in prayer but this two-fold force,"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",3,3,KING CLAUDIUS,15,"To be forestalled ere we come to fall,"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",3,3,KING CLAUDIUS,16,Or pardon'd being down? Then I'll look up;
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",3,3,KING CLAUDIUS,17,"My fault is past. But, O, what form of prayer"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",3,3,KING CLAUDIUS,18,Can serve my turn? 'Forgive me my foul murder'?
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",3,3,KING CLAUDIUS,19,That cannot be; since I am still possess'd
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",3,3,KING CLAUDIUS,20,"Of those effects for which I did the murder,"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",3,3,KING CLAUDIUS,21,"My crown, mine own ambition and my queen."
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",3,3,KING CLAUDIUS,22,May one be pardon'd and retain the offence?
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",3,3,KING CLAUDIUS,23,In the corrupted currents of this world
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",3,3,KING CLAUDIUS,24,"Offence's gilded hand may shove by justice,"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",3,3,KING CLAUDIUS,25,And oft 'tis seen the wicked prize itself
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",3,3,KING CLAUDIUS,26,Buys out the law: but 'tis not so above;
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",3,3,KING CLAUDIUS,27,"There is no shuffling, there the action lies"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",3,3,KING CLAUDIUS,28,"In his true nature; and we ourselves compell'd,"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",3,3,KING CLAUDIUS,29,"Even to the teeth and forehead of our faults,"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",3,3,KING CLAUDIUS,30,To give in evidence. What then? what rests?
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",3,3,KING CLAUDIUS,31,Try what repentance can: what can it not?
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",3,3,KING CLAUDIUS,32,Yet what can it when one can not repent?
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",3,3,KING CLAUDIUS,33,O wretched state! O bosom black as death!
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",3,3,KING CLAUDIUS,34,"O limed soul, that, struggling to be free,"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",3,3,KING CLAUDIUS,35,"Art more engaged! Help, angels! Make assay!"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",3,3,KING CLAUDIUS,36,"Bow, stubborn knees; and, heart with strings of steel,"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",3,3,KING CLAUDIUS,37,Be soft as sinews of the newborn babe!
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",3,3,KING CLAUDIUS,38,All may be well.
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",3,3,HAMLET,1,"Now might I do it pat, now he is praying;"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",3,3,HAMLET,2,And now I'll do't. And so he goes to heaven;
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",3,3,HAMLET,3,And so am I revenged. That would be scann'd:
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",3,3,HAMLET,4,"A villain kills my father; and for that,"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",3,3,HAMLET,5,"I, his sole son, do this same villain send"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",3,3,HAMLET,6,To heaven.
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",3,3,HAMLET,7,"O, this is hire and salary, not revenge."
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",3,3,HAMLET,8,"He took my father grossly, full of bread;"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",3,3,HAMLET,9,"With all his crimes broad blown, as flush as May;"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",3,3,HAMLET,10,And how his audit stands who knows save heaven?
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",3,3,HAMLET,11,"But in our circumstance and course of thought,"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",3,3,HAMLET,12,"'Tis heavy with him: and am I then revenged,"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",3,3,HAMLET,13,"To take him in the purging of his soul,"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",3,3,HAMLET,14,When he is fit and season'd for his passage?
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",3,3,HAMLET,15,No!
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",3,3,HAMLET,16,"Up, sword; and know thou a more horrid hent:"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",3,3,HAMLET,17,"When he is drunk asleep, or in his rage,"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",3,3,HAMLET,18,Or in the incestuous pleasure of his bed;
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",3,3,HAMLET,19,"At gaming, swearing, or about some act"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",3,3,HAMLET,20,That has no relish of salvation in't;
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",3,3,HAMLET,21,"Then trip him, that his heels may kick at heaven,"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",3,3,HAMLET,22,And that his soul may be as damn'd and black
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",3,3,HAMLET,23,"As hell, whereto it goes. My mother stays:"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",3,3,HAMLET,24,This physic but prolongs thy sickly days.
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",3,3,KING CLAUDIUS,1,Words without thoughts never to heaven go.
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",3,4,LORD POLONIUS,1,He will come straight. Look you lay home to him:
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",3,4,LORD POLONIUS,2,"Tell him his pranks have been too broad to bear with,"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",3,4,LORD POLONIUS,3,And that your grace hath screen'd and stood between
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",3,4,LORD POLONIUS,4,Much heat and him. I'll sconce me even here.
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",3,4,LORD POLONIUS,5,"Pray you, be round with him."
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",3,4,QUEEN GERTRUDE,1,"I'll warrant you,"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",3,4,QUEEN GERTRUDE,2,"Fear me not: withdraw, I hear him coming."
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",3,4,HAMLET,1,"Now, mother, what's the matter?"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",3,4,QUEEN GERTRUDE,1,"Hamlet, thou hast thy father much offended."
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",3,4,HAMLET,1,"Mother, you have my father much offended."
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",3,4,QUEEN GERTRUDE,1,"Come, come, you answer with an idle tongue."
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",3,4,HAMLET,1,"Go, go, you question with a wicked tongue."
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",3,4,QUEEN GERTRUDE,1,"Why, how now, Hamlet!"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",3,4,HAMLET,1,What's the matter now?
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",3,4,QUEEN GERTRUDE,1,Have you forgot me?
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",3,4,HAMLET,1,"No, by the rood, not so:"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",3,4,HAMLET,2,"You are the queen, your husband's brother's wife;"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",3,4,HAMLET,3,And--would it were not so!--you are my mother.
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",3,4,QUEEN GERTRUDE,1,"Nay, then, I'll set those to you that can speak."
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",3,4,HAMLET,1,"Come, come, and sit you down; you shall not budge;"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",3,4,HAMLET,2,You go not till I set you up a glass
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",3,4,HAMLET,3,Where you may see the inmost part of you.
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",3,4,QUEEN GERTRUDE,1,What wilt thou do? thou wilt not murder me?
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",3,4,QUEEN GERTRUDE,2,"Help, help, ho!"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",3,4,QUEEN GERTRUDE,1,"O me, what hast thou done?"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",3,4,HAMLET,1,"Nay, I know not:"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",3,4,HAMLET,2,Is it the king?
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",3,4,QUEEN GERTRUDE,1,"O, what a rash and bloody deed is this!"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",3,4,HAMLET,1,"A bloody deed! almost as bad, good mother,"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",3,4,HAMLET,2,"As kill a king, and marry with his brother."
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",3,4,QUEEN GERTRUDE,1,As kill a king!
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",3,4,HAMLET,1,"Ay, lady, 'twas my word."
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",3,4,HAMLET,2,"Thou wretched, rash, intruding fool, farewell!"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",3,4,HAMLET,3,I took thee for thy better: take thy fortune;
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",3,4,HAMLET,4,Thou find'st to be too busy is some danger.
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",3,4,HAMLET,5,"Leave wringing of your hands: peace! sit you down,"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",3,4,HAMLET,6,"And let me wring your heart; for so I shall,"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",3,4,HAMLET,7,"If it be made of penetrable stuff,"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",3,4,HAMLET,8,If damned custom have not brass'd it so
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",3,4,HAMLET,9,That it is proof and bulwark against sense.
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",3,4,QUEEN GERTRUDE,1,"What have I done, that thou darest wag thy tongue"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",3,4,QUEEN GERTRUDE,2,In noise so rude against me?
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",3,4,HAMLET,1,Such an act
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",3,4,HAMLET,2,"That blurs the grace and blush of modesty,"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",3,4,HAMLET,3,"Calls virtue hypocrite, takes off the rose"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",3,4,HAMLET,4,From the fair forehead of an innocent love
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",3,4,HAMLET,5,"And sets a blister there, makes marriage-vows"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",3,4,HAMLET,6,"As false as dicers' oaths: O, such a deed"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",3,4,HAMLET,7,As from the body of contraction plucks
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",3,4,HAMLET,8,"The very soul, and sweet religion makes"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",3,4,HAMLET,9,A rhapsody of words: heaven's face doth glow:
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",3,4,HAMLET,10,"Yea, this solidity and compound mass,"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",3,4,HAMLET,11,"With tristful visage, as against the doom,"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",3,4,HAMLET,12,Is thought-sick at the act.
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",3,4,QUEEN GERTRUDE,1,"Ay me, what act,"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",3,4,QUEEN GERTRUDE,2,"That roars so loud, and thunders in the index?"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",3,4,HAMLET,1,"Look here, upon this picture, and on this,"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",3,4,HAMLET,2,The counterfeit presentment of two brothers.
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",3,4,HAMLET,3,"See, what a grace was seated on this brow;"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",3,4,HAMLET,4,Hyperion's curls; the front of Jove himself;
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",3,4,HAMLET,5,"An eye like Mars, to threaten and command;"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",3,4,HAMLET,6,A station like the herald Mercury
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",3,4,HAMLET,7,New-lighted on a heaven-kissing hill;
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",3,4,HAMLET,8,"A combination and a form indeed,"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",3,4,HAMLET,9,"Where every god did seem to set his seal,"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",3,4,HAMLET,10,To give the world assurance of a man:
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",3,4,HAMLET,11,"This was your husband. Look you now, what follows:"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",3,4,HAMLET,12,"Here is your husband; like a mildew'd ear,"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",3,4,HAMLET,13,Blasting his wholesome brother. Have you eyes?
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",3,4,HAMLET,14,"Could you on this fair mountain leave to feed,"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",3,4,HAMLET,15,And batten on this moor? Ha! have you eyes?
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",3,4,HAMLET,16,You cannot call it love; for at your age
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",3,4,HAMLET,17,"The hey-day in the blood is tame, it's humble,"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",3,4,HAMLET,18,And waits upon the judgment: and what judgment
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",3,4,HAMLET,19,"Would step from this to this? Sense, sure, you have,"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",3,4,HAMLET,20,"Else could you not have motion; but sure, that sense"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",3,4,HAMLET,21,"Is apoplex'd; for madness would not err,"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",3,4,HAMLET,22,Nor sense to ecstasy was ne'er so thrall'd
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",3,4,HAMLET,23,"But it reserved some quantity of choice,"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",3,4,HAMLET,24,To serve in such a difference. What devil was't
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",3,4,HAMLET,25,That thus hath cozen'd you at hoodman-blind?
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",3,4,HAMLET,26,"Eyes without feeling, feeling without sight,"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",3,4,HAMLET,27,"Ears without hands or eyes, smelling sans all,"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",3,4,HAMLET,28,Or but a sickly part of one true sense
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",3,4,HAMLET,29,Could not so mope.
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",3,4,HAMLET,30,"O shame! where is thy blush? Rebellious hell,"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",3,4,HAMLET,31,"If thou canst mutine in a matron's bones,"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",3,4,HAMLET,32,"To flaming youth let virtue be as wax,"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",3,4,HAMLET,33,And melt in her own fire: proclaim no shame
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",3,4,HAMLET,34,"When the compulsive ardour gives the charge,"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",3,4,HAMLET,35,Since frost itself as actively doth burn
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",3,4,HAMLET,36,And reason panders will.
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",3,4,QUEEN GERTRUDE,1,"O Hamlet, speak no more:"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",3,4,QUEEN GERTRUDE,2,Thou turn'st mine eyes into my very soul;
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",3,4,QUEEN GERTRUDE,3,And there I see such black and grained spots
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",3,4,QUEEN GERTRUDE,4,As will not leave their tinct.
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",3,4,HAMLET,1,"Nay, but to live"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",3,4,HAMLET,2,"In the rank sweat of an enseamed bed,"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",3,4,HAMLET,3,"Stew'd in corruption, honeying and making love"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",3,4,HAMLET,4,"Over the nasty sty,--"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",3,4,QUEEN GERTRUDE,1,"O, speak to me no more;"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",3,4,QUEEN GERTRUDE,2,"These words, like daggers, enter in mine ears;"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",3,4,QUEEN GERTRUDE,3,"No more, sweet Hamlet!"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",3,4,HAMLET,1,A murderer and a villain;
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",3,4,HAMLET,2,A slave that is not twentieth part the tithe
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",3,4,HAMLET,3,Of your precedent lord; a vice of kings;
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",3,4,HAMLET,4,"A cutpurse of the empire and the rule,"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",3,4,HAMLET,5,"That from a shelf the precious diadem stole,"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",3,4,HAMLET,6,And put it in his pocket!
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",3,4,QUEEN GERTRUDE,1,No more!
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",3,4,HAMLET,1,"A king of shreds and patches,--"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",3,4,HAMLET,2,"Save me, and hover o'er me with your wings,"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",3,4,HAMLET,3,You heavenly guards! What would your gracious figure?
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",3,4,QUEEN GERTRUDE,1,"Alas, he's mad!"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",3,4,HAMLET,1,"Do you not come your tardy son to chide,"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",3,4,HAMLET,2,"That, lapsed in time and passion, lets go by"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",3,4,HAMLET,3,"The important acting of your dread command? O, say!"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",3,4,GHOST,1,Do not forget: this visitation
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",3,4,GHOST,2,Is but to whet thy almost blunted purpose.
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",3,4,GHOST,3,"But, look, amazement on thy mother sits:"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",3,4,GHOST,4,"O, step between her and her fighting soul:"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",3,4,GHOST,5,Conceit in weakest bodies strongest works:
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",3,4,GHOST,6,"Speak to her, Hamlet."
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",3,4,HAMLET,1,"How is it with you, lady?"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",3,4,QUEEN GERTRUDE,1,"Alas, how is't with you,"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",3,4,QUEEN GERTRUDE,2,That you do bend your eye on vacancy
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",3,4,QUEEN GERTRUDE,3,And with the incorporal air do hold discourse?
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",3,4,QUEEN GERTRUDE,4,Forth at your eyes your spirits wildly peep;
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",3,4,QUEEN GERTRUDE,5,"And, as the sleeping soldiers in the alarm,"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",3,4,QUEEN GERTRUDE,6,"Your bedded hair, like life in excrements,"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",3,4,QUEEN GERTRUDE,7,"Starts up, and stands on end. O gentle son,"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",3,4,QUEEN GERTRUDE,8,Upon the heat and flame of thy distemper
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",3,4,QUEEN GERTRUDE,9,Sprinkle cool patience. Whereon do you look?
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",3,4,HAMLET,1,"On him, on him! Look you, how pale he glares!"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",3,4,HAMLET,2,"His form and cause conjoin'd, preaching to stones,"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",3,4,HAMLET,3,Would make them capable. Do not look upon me;
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",3,4,HAMLET,4,Lest with this piteous action you convert
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",3,4,HAMLET,5,My stern effects: then what I have to do
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",3,4,HAMLET,6,Will want true colour; tears perchance for blood.
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",3,4,QUEEN GERTRUDE,1,To whom do you speak this?
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",3,4,HAMLET,1,Do you see nothing there?
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",3,4,QUEEN GERTRUDE,1,Nothing at all; yet all that is I see.
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",3,4,HAMLET,1,Nor did you nothing hear?
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",3,4,QUEEN GERTRUDE,1,"No, nothing but ourselves."
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",3,4,HAMLET,1,"Why, look you there! look, how it steals away!"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",3,4,HAMLET,2,"My father, in his habit as he lived!"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",3,4,HAMLET,3,"Look, where he goes, even now, out at the portal!"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",3,4,QUEEN GERTRUDE,1,This the very coinage of your brain:
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",3,4,QUEEN GERTRUDE,2,This bodiless creation ecstasy
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",3,4,QUEEN GERTRUDE,3,Is very cunning in.
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",3,4,HAMLET,1,Ecstasy!
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",3,4,HAMLET,2,"My pulse, as yours, doth temperately keep time,"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",3,4,HAMLET,3,And makes as healthful music: it is not madness
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",3,4,HAMLET,4,"That I have utter'd: bring me to the test,"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",3,4,HAMLET,5,And I the matter will re-word; which madness
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",3,4,HAMLET,6,"Would gambol from. Mother, for love of grace,"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",3,4,HAMLET,7,"Lay not that mattering unction to your soul,"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",3,4,HAMLET,8,"That not your trespass, but my madness speaks:"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",3,4,HAMLET,9,"It will but skin and film the ulcerous place,"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",3,4,HAMLET,10,"Whilst rank corruption, mining all within,"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",3,4,HAMLET,11,Infects unseen. Confess yourself to heaven;
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",3,4,HAMLET,12,Repent what's past; avoid what is to come;
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",3,4,HAMLET,13,"And do not spread the compost on the weeds,"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",3,4,HAMLET,14,To make them ranker. Forgive me this my virtue;
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",3,4,HAMLET,15,For in the fatness of these pursy times
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",3,4,HAMLET,16,"Virtue itself of vice must pardon beg,"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",3,4,HAMLET,17,"Yea, curb and woo for leave to do him good."
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",3,4,QUEEN GERTRUDE,1,"O Hamlet, thou hast cleft my heart in twain."
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",3,4,HAMLET,1,"O, throw away the worser part of it,"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",3,4,HAMLET,2,And live the purer with the other half.
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",3,4,HAMLET,3,Good night: but go not to mine uncle's bed;
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",3,4,HAMLET,4,"Assume a virtue, if you have it not."
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",3,4,HAMLET,5,"That monster, custom, who all sense doth eat,"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",3,4,HAMLET,6,"Of habits devil, is angel yet in this,"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",3,4,HAMLET,7,That to the use of actions fair and good
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",3,4,HAMLET,8,"He likewise gives a frock or livery,"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",3,4,HAMLET,9,"That aptly is put on. Refrain to-night,"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",3,4,HAMLET,10,And that shall lend a kind of easiness
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",3,4,HAMLET,11,To the next abstinence: the next more easy;
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",3,4,HAMLET,12,"For use almost can change the stamp of nature,"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",3,4,HAMLET,13,"And either ... the devil, or throw him out"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",3,4,HAMLET,14,"With wondrous potency. Once more, good night:"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",3,4,HAMLET,15,"And when you are desirous to be bless'd,"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",3,4,HAMLET,16,"I'll blessing beg of you. For this same lord,"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",3,4,HAMLET,17,"I do repent: but heaven hath pleased it so,"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",3,4,HAMLET,18,"To punish me with this and this with me,"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",3,4,HAMLET,19,That I must be their scourge and minister.
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",3,4,HAMLET,20,"I will bestow him, and will answer well"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",3,4,HAMLET,21,"The death I gave him. So, again, good night."
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",3,4,HAMLET,22,"I must be cruel, only to be kind:"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",3,4,HAMLET,23,Thus bad begins and worse remains behind.
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",3,4,HAMLET,24,"One word more, good lady."
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",3,4,QUEEN GERTRUDE,1,What shall I do?
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",3,4,HAMLET,1,"Not this, by no means, that I bid you do:"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",3,4,HAMLET,2,Let the bloat king tempt you again to bed;

"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",4,2,HAMLET,1,What noise? who calls on Hamlet?
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",4,2,HAMLET,2,"O, here they come."
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",4,2,ROSENCRANTZ,1,"What have you done, my lord, with the dead body?"

"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",4,2,HAMLET,1,Do not believe it.
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",4,2,ROSENCRANTZ,1,Believe what?
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",4,2,HAMLET,1,That I can keep your counsel and not mine own.

"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",4,2,HAMLET,1,"Ay, sir, that soaks up the king's countenance, his"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",4,2,HAMLET,2,"rewards, his authorities. But such officers do the"

"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",4,2,ROSENCRANTZ,1,"I understand you not, my lord."
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",4,2,HAMLET,1,I am glad of it: a knavish speech sleeps in a

"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",4,2,ROSENCRANTZ,1,"My lord, you must tell us where the body is, and go"

"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",4,2,HAMLET,1,"The body is with the king, but the king is not with"

"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",4,2,HAMLET,1,"Of nothing: bring me to him. Hide fox, and all after."
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",4,3,KING CLAUDIUS,1,"I have sent to seek him, and to find the body."
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",4,3,KING CLAUDIUS,2,How dangerous is it that this man goes loose!
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",4,3,KING CLAUDIUS,3,Yet must not we put the strong law on him:
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",4,3,KING CLAUDIUS,4,"He's loved of the distracted multitude,"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",4,3,KING CLAUDIUS,5,"Who like not in their judgment, but their eyes;"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",4,3,KING CLAUDIUS,6,"And where tis so, the offender's scourge is weigh'd,"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",4,3,KING CLAUDIUS,7,"But never the offence. To bear all smooth and even,"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",4,3,KING CLAUDIUS,8,This sudden sending him away must seem
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",4,3,KING CLAUDIUS,9,Deliberate pause: diseases desperate grown

"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",4,3,KING CLAUDIUS,11,Or not at all.
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",4,3,KING CLAUDIUS,12,How now! what hath befall'n?
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",4,3,ROSENCRANTZ,1,"Where the dead body is bestow'd, my lord,"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",4,3,ROSENCRANTZ,2,We cannot get from him.
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",4,3,KING CLAUDIUS,1,But where is he?
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",4,3,ROSENCRANTZ,1,"Without, my lord; guarded, to know your pleasure."
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",4,3,KING CLAUDIUS,1,Bring him before us.
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",4,3,ROSENCRANTZ,1,"Ho, Guildenstern! bring in my lord."
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",4,3,KING CLAUDIUS,1,"Now, Hamlet, where's Polonius?"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",4,3,HAMLET,1,At supper.
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",4,3,KING CLAUDIUS,1,At supper! where?
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",4,3,HAMLET,1,"Not where he eats, but where he is eaten: a certain"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",4,3,HAMLET,2,convocation of politic worms are e'en at him. Your
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",4,3,HAMLET,3,worm is your only emperor for diet: we fat all
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",4,3,HAMLET,4,"creatures else to fat us, and we fat ourselves for"

"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",4,3,HAMLET,7,that's the end.
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",4,3,KING CLAUDIUS,1,"Alas, alas!"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",4,3,HAMLET,1,A man may fish with the worm that hath eat of a
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",4,3,HAMLET,2,"king, and cat of the fish that hath fed of that worm."
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",4,3,KING CLAUDIUS,1,What dost you mean by this?
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",4,3,HAMLET,1,Nothing but to show you how a king may go a
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",4,3,HAMLET,2,progress through the guts of a beggar.
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",4,3,KING CLAUDIUS,1,Where is Polonius?
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",4,3,HAMLET,1,In heaven; send hither to see: if your messenger
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",4,3,HAMLET,2,"find him not there, seek him i' the other place"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",4,3,HAMLET,3,"yourself. But indeed, if you find him not within"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",4,3,HAMLET,4,"this month, you shall nose him as you go up the"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",4,3,HAMLET,5,stairs into the lobby.
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",4,3,KING CLAUDIUS,1,Go seek him there.
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",4,3,HAMLET,1,He will stay till ye come.
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",4,3,KING CLAUDIUS,1,"Hamlet, this deed, for thine especial safety,--"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",4,3,KING CLAUDIUS,2,"Which we do tender, as we dearly grieve"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",4,3,KING CLAUDIUS,3,"For that which thou hast done,--must send thee hence"

"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",4,3,HAMLET,1,Good.
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",4,3,KING CLAUDIUS,1,"So is it, if thou knew'st our purposes."
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",4,3,HAMLET,1,"I see a cherub that sees them. But, come; for"

"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",4,3,KING CLAUDIUS,1,"Thy loving father, Hamlet."

"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",4,3,KING CLAUDIUS,1,Follow him at foot; tempt him with speed aboard;
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",4,3,KING CLAUDIUS,2,Delay it not; I'll have him hence to-night:
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",4,3,KING CLAUDIUS,3,Away! for every thing is seal'd and done
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",4,3,KING CLAUDIUS,4,"That else leans on the affair: pray you, make haste."
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",4,3,KING CLAUDIUS,5,"And, England, if my love thou hold'st at aught--"

"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",4,4,HAMLET,1,"Goes it against the main of Poland, sir,"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",4,4,HAMLET,2,Or for some frontier?
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",4,4,CAPTAIN,1,"Truly to speak, and with no addition,"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",4,4,CAPTAIN,2,We go to gain a little patch of ground
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",4,4,CAPTAIN,3,That hath in it no profit but the name.

"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",4,5,LAERTES,10,It sends some precious instance of itself
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",4,5,LAERTES,11,After the thing it loves.
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",4,5,OPHELIA,1,They bore him barefaced on the bier;
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",4,5,OPHELIA,2,"Hey non nonny, nonny, hey nonny;"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",4,5,OPHELIA,3,And in his grave rain'd many a tear:--
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",4,5,OPHELIA,4,"Fare you well, my dove!"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",4,5,LAERTES,1,"Hadst thou thy wits, and didst persuade revenge,"

"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",4,5,OPHELIA,4,"steward, that stole his master's daughter."
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",4,5,LAERTES,1,This nothing's more than matter.
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",4,5,OPHELIA,1,"There's rosemary, that's for remembrance; pray,"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",4,5,OPHELIA,2,"love, remember: and there is pansies. that's for thoughts."
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",4,5,LAERTES,1,"A document in madness, thoughts and remembrance fitted."

"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",4,5,OPHELIA,3,herb-grace o' Sundays: O you must wear your rue with
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",4,5,OPHELIA,4,a difference. There's a daisy: I would give you
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",4,5,OPHELIA,5,"some violets, but they withered all when my father"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",4,5,OPHELIA,6,"died: they say he made a good end,--"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",4,5,OPHELIA,7,For bonny sweet Robin is all my joy.
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",4,5,LAERTES,1,"Thought and affliction, passion, hell itself,"

"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",4,5,OPHELIA,2,And will he not come again?
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",4,5,OPHELIA,3,"No, no, he is dead:"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",4,5,OPHELIA,4,Go to thy death-bed:
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",4,5,OPHELIA,5,He never will come again.
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",4,5,OPHELIA,6,"His beard was as white as snow,"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",4,5,OPHELIA,7,All flaxen was his poll:
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",4,5,OPHELIA,8,"He is gone, he is gone,"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",4,5,OPHELIA,9,And we cast away moan:
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",4,5,OPHELIA,10,God ha' mercy on his soul!
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",4,5,OPHELIA,11,"And of all Christian souls, I pray God. God be wi' ye."
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",4,5,LAERTES,1,"Do you see this, O God?"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",4,5,KING CLAUDIUS,1,"Laertes, I must commune with your grief,"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",4,5,KING CLAUDIUS,2,"Or you deny me right. Go but apart,"

"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",4,5,KING CLAUDIUS,10,And we shall jointly labour with your soul
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",4,5,KING CLAUDIUS,11,To give it due content.
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",4,5,LAERTES,1,Let this be so;
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",4,5,LAERTES,2,"His means of death, his obscure funeral--"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",4,5,LAERTES,3,"No trophy, sword, nor hatchment o'er his bones,"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",4,5,LAERTES,4,No noble rite nor formal ostentation--
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",4,5,LAERTES,5,"Cry to be heard, as 'twere from heaven to earth,"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",4,5,LAERTES,6,That I must call't in question.

"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",4,5,KING CLAUDIUS,2,And where the offence is let the great axe fall.
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",4,5,KING CLAUDIUS,3,"I pray you, go with me."
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",4,6,HORATIO,1,What are they that would speak with me?
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",4,6,SERVANT,1,"Sailors, sir: they say they have letters for you."
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",4,6,HORATIO,1,Let them come in.
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",4,6,HORATIO,2,I do not know from what part of the world
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",4,6,HORATIO,3,"I should be greeted, if not from Lord Hamlet."
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",4,6,FIRST SAILOR,1,"God bless you, sir."
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",4,6,HORATIO,1,Let him bless thee too.
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",4,6,FIRST SAILOR,1,"He shall, sir, an't please him. There's a letter for"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",4,6,FIRST SAILOR,2,"you, sir; it comes from the ambassador that was"

"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",4,6,HORATIO,1,"this, give these fellows some means to the king:"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",4,6,HORATIO,2,they have letters for him. Ere we were two days old
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",4,6,HORATIO,3,"at sea, a pirate of very warlike appointment gave us"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",4,6,HORATIO,4,"chase. Finding ourselves too slow of sail, we put on"

"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",4,6,HORATIO,9,did; I am to do a good turn for them. Let the king

"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",4,6,HORATIO,11,with as much speed as thou wouldst fly death. I

"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",4,6,HORATIO,13,dumb; yet are they much too light for the bore of
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",4,6,HORATIO,14,the matter. These good fellows will bring thee
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",4,6,HORATIO,15,where I am. Rosencrantz and Guildenstern hold their
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",4,6,HORATIO,16,course for England: of them I have much to tell
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",4,6,HORATIO,17,thee. Farewell.
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",4,6,HORATIO,18,"'He that thou knowest thine, HAMLET.'"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",4,6,HORATIO,19,"Come, I will make you way for these your letters;"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",4,6,HORATIO,20,"And do't the speedier, that you may direct me"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",4,6,HORATIO,21,To him from whom you brought them.
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",4,7,KING CLAUDIUS,1,"Now must your conscience my acquaintance seal,"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",4,7,KING CLAUDIUS,2,"And you must put me in your heart for friend,"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",4,7,KING CLAUDIUS,3,"Sith you have heard, and with a knowing ear,"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",4,7,KING CLAUDIUS,4,That he which hath your noble father slain
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",4,7,KING CLAUDIUS,5,Pursued my life.
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",4,7,LAERTES,1,It well appears: but tell me
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",4,7,LAERTES,2,"Why you proceeded not against these feats,"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",4,7,LAERTES,3,"So crimeful and so capital in nature,"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",4,7,LAERTES,4,"As by your safety, wisdom, all things else,"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",4,7,LAERTES,5,You mainly were stirr'd up.
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",4,7,KING CLAUDIUS,1,"O, for two special reasons;"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",4,7,KING CLAUDIUS,2,"Which may to you, perhaps, seem much unsinew'd,"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",4,7,KING CLAUDIUS,3,But yet to me they are strong. The queen his mother
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",4,7,KING CLAUDIUS,4,Lives almost by his looks; and for myself--
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",4,7,KING CLAUDIUS,5,"My virtue or my plague, be it either which--"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",4,7,KING CLAUDIUS,6,"She's so conjunctive to my life and soul,"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",4,7,KING CLAUDIUS,7,"That, as the star moves not but in his sphere,"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",4,7,KING CLAUDIUS,8,"I could not but by her. The other motive,"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",4,7,KING CLAUDIUS,9,"Why to a public count I might not go,"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",4,7,KING CLAUDIUS,10,Is the great love the general gender bear him;
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",4,7,KING CLAUDIUS,11,"Who, dipping all his faults in their affection,"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",4,7,KING CLAUDIUS,12,"Would, like the spring that turneth wood to stone,"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",4,7,KING CLAUDIUS,13,"Convert his gyves to graces; so that my arrows,"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",4,7,KING CLAUDIUS,14,"Too slightly timber'd for so loud a wind,"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",4,7,KING CLAUDIUS,15,"Would have reverted to my bow again,"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",4,7,KING CLAUDIUS,16,And not where I had aim'd them.
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",4,7,LAERTES,1,And so have I a noble father lost;
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",4,7,LAERTES,2,"A sister driven into desperate terms,"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",4,7,LAERTES,3,"Whose worth, if praises may go back again,"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",4,7,LAERTES,4,Stood challenger on mount of all the age
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",4,7,LAERTES,5,For her perfections: but my revenge will come.
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",4,7,KING CLAUDIUS,1,Break not your sleeps for that: you must not think
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",4,7,KING CLAUDIUS,2,That we are made of stuff so flat and dull
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",4,7,KING CLAUDIUS,3,That we can let our beard be shook with danger
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",4,7,KING CLAUDIUS,4,And think it pastime. You shortly shall hear more:
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",4,7,KING CLAUDIUS,5,"I loved your father, and we love ourself;"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",4,7,KING CLAUDIUS,6,"And that, I hope, will teach you to imagine--"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",4,7,KING CLAUDIUS,7,How now! what news?
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",4,7,MESSENGER,1,"Letters, my lord, from Hamlet:"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",4,7,MESSENGER,2,This to your majesty; this to the queen.
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",4,7,KING CLAUDIUS,1,From Hamlet! who brought them?
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",4,7,MESSENGER,1,"Sailors, my lord, they say; I saw them not:"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",4,7,MESSENGER,2,They were given me by Claudio; he received them
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",4,7,MESSENGER,3,Of him that brought them.
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",4,7,KING CLAUDIUS,1,"Laertes, you shall hear them. Leave us."
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",4,7,KING CLAUDIUS,2,"'High and mighty, You shall know I am set naked on"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",4,7,KING CLAUDIUS,3,your kingdom. To-morrow shall I beg leave to see
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",4,7,KING CLAUDIUS,4,"your kingly eyes: when I shall, first asking your"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",4,7,KING CLAUDIUS,5,"pardon thereunto, recount the occasion of my sudden"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",4,7,KING CLAUDIUS,6,and more strange return.                  'HAMLET.'
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",4,7,KING CLAUDIUS,7,What should this mean? Are all the rest come back?
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",4,7,KING CLAUDIUS,8,"Or is it some abuse, and no such thing?"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",4,7,LAERTES,1,Know you the hand?
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",4,7,KING CLAUDIUS,1,'Tis Hamlets character. 'Naked!
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",4,7,KING CLAUDIUS,2,"And in a postscript here, he says 'alone.'"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",4,7,KING CLAUDIUS,3,Can you advise me?
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",4,7,LAERTES,1,"I'm lost in it, my lord. But let him come;"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",4,7,LAERTES,2,"It warms the very sickness in my heart,"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",4,7,LAERTES,3,"That I shall live and tell him to his teeth,"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",4,7,LAERTES,4,'Thus didest thou.'
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",4,7,KING CLAUDIUS,1,"If it be so, Laertes--"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",4,7,KING CLAUDIUS,2,As how should it be so? how otherwise?--
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",4,7,KING CLAUDIUS,3,Will you be ruled by me?
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",4,7,LAERTES,1,"Ay, my lord;"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",4,7,LAERTES,2,So you will not o'errule me to a peace.
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",4,7,KING CLAUDIUS,1,"To thine own peace. If he be now return'd,"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",4,7,KING CLAUDIUS,2,"As checking at his voyage, and that he means"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",4,7,KING CLAUDIUS,3,"No more to undertake it, I will work him"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",4,7,KING CLAUDIUS,4,"To an exploit, now ripe in my device,"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",4,7,KING CLAUDIUS,5,Under the which he shall not choose but fall:
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",4,7,KING CLAUDIUS,6,"And for his death no wind of blame shall breathe,"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",4,7,KING CLAUDIUS,7,But even his mother shall uncharge the practise
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",4,7,KING CLAUDIUS,8,And call it accident.
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",4,7,LAERTES,1,"My lord, I will be ruled;"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",4,7,LAERTES,2,"The rather, if you could devise it so"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",4,7,LAERTES,3,That I might be the organ.
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",4,7,KING CLAUDIUS,1,It falls right.
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",4,7,KING CLAUDIUS,2,"You have been talk'd of since your travel much,"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",4,7,KING CLAUDIUS,3,"And that in Hamlet's hearing, for a quality"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",4,7,KING CLAUDIUS,4,"Wherein, they say, you shine: your sum of parts"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",4,7,KING CLAUDIUS,5,Did not together pluck such envy from him
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",4,7,KING CLAUDIUS,6,"As did that one, and that, in my regard,"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",4,7,KING CLAUDIUS,7,Of the unworthiest siege.
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",4,7,LAERTES,1,"What part is that, my lord?"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",4,7,KING CLAUDIUS,1,"A very riband in the cap of youth,"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",4,7,KING CLAUDIUS,2,Yet needful too; for youth no less becomes
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",4,7,KING CLAUDIUS,3,The light and careless livery that it wears
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",4,7,KING CLAUDIUS,4,"Than settled age his sables and his weeds,"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",4,7,KING CLAUDIUS,5,"Importing health and graveness. Two months since,"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",4,7,KING CLAUDIUS,6,Here was a gentleman of Normandy:--
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",4,7,KING CLAUDIUS,7,"I've seen myself, and served against, the French,"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",4,7,KING CLAUDIUS,8,And they can well on horseback: but this gallant
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",4,7,KING CLAUDIUS,9,Had witchcraft in't; he grew unto his seat;
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",4,7,KING CLAUDIUS,10,"And to such wondrous doing brought his horse,"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",4,7,KING CLAUDIUS,11,As he had been incorpsed and demi-natured
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",4,7,KING CLAUDIUS,12,"With the brave beast: so far he topp'd my thought,"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",4,7,KING CLAUDIUS,13,"That I, in forgery of shapes and tricks,"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",4,7,KING CLAUDIUS,14,Come short of what he did.
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",4,7,LAERTES,1,A Norman was't?
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",4,7,KING CLAUDIUS,1,A Norman.
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",4,7,LAERTES,1,"Upon my life, Lamond."
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",4,7,KING CLAUDIUS,1,The very same.
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",4,7,LAERTES,1,I know him well: he is the brooch indeed
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",4,7,LAERTES,2,And gem of all the nation.
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",4,7,KING CLAUDIUS,1,"He made confession of you,"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",4,7,KING CLAUDIUS,2,And gave you such a masterly report
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",4,7,KING CLAUDIUS,3,For art and exercise in your defence
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",4,7,KING CLAUDIUS,4,"And for your rapier most especially,"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",4,7,KING CLAUDIUS,5,"That he cried out, 'twould be a sight indeed,"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",4,7,KING CLAUDIUS,6,"If one could match you: the scrimers of their nation,"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",4,7,KING CLAUDIUS,7,"He swore, had had neither motion, guard, nor eye,"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",4,7,KING CLAUDIUS,8,"If you opposed them. Sir, this report of his"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",4,7,KING CLAUDIUS,9,Did Hamlet so envenom with his envy
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",4,7,KING CLAUDIUS,10,That he could nothing do but wish and beg
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",4,7,KING CLAUDIUS,11,"Your sudden coming o'er, to play with him."
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",4,7,KING CLAUDIUS,12,"Now, out of this,--"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",4,7,LAERTES,1,"What out of this, my lord?"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",4,7,KING CLAUDIUS,1,"Laertes, was your father dear to you?"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",4,7,KING CLAUDIUS,2,"Or are you like the painting of a sorrow,"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",4,7,KING CLAUDIUS,3,A face without a heart?
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",4,7,LAERTES,1,Why ask you this?
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",4,7,KING CLAUDIUS,1,Not that I think you did not love your father;
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",4,7,KING CLAUDIUS,2,But that I know love is begun by time;
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",4,7,KING CLAUDIUS,3,"And that I see, in passages of proof,"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",4,7,KING CLAUDIUS,4,Time qualifies the spark and fire of it.
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",4,7,KING CLAUDIUS,5,There lives within the very flame of love
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",4,7,KING CLAUDIUS,6,A kind of wick or snuff that will abate it;
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",4,7,KING CLAUDIUS,7,And nothing is at a like goodness still;
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",4,7,KING CLAUDIUS,8,"For goodness, growing to a plurisy,"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",4,7,KING CLAUDIUS,9,Dies in his own too much: that we would do
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",4,7,KING CLAUDIUS,10,We should do when we would; for this 'would' changes
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",4,7,KING CLAUDIUS,11,And hath abatements and delays as many
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",4,7,KING CLAUDIUS,12,"As there are tongues, are hands, are accidents;"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",4,7,KING CLAUDIUS,13,"And then this 'should' is like a spendthrift sigh,"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",4,7,KING CLAUDIUS,14,"That hurts by easing. But, to the quick o' the ulcer:--"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",4,7,KING CLAUDIUS,15,"Hamlet comes back: what would you undertake,"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",4,7,KING CLAUDIUS,16,To show yourself your father's son in deed
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",4,7,KING CLAUDIUS,17,More than in words?
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",4,7,LAERTES,1,To cut his throat i' the church.
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",4,7,KING CLAUDIUS,1,"No place, indeed, should murder sanctuarize;"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",4,7,KING CLAUDIUS,2,"Revenge should have no bounds. But, good Laertes,"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",4,7,KING CLAUDIUS,3,"Will you do this, keep close within your chamber."
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",4,7,KING CLAUDIUS,4,Hamlet return'd shall know you are come home:
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",4,7,KING CLAUDIUS,5,We'll put on those shall praise your excellence
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",4,7,KING CLAUDIUS,6,And set a double varnish on the fame
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",4,7,KING CLAUDIUS,7,"The Frenchman gave you, bring you in fine together"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",4,7,KING CLAUDIUS,8,"And wager on your heads: he, being remiss,"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",4,7,KING CLAUDIUS,9,"Most generous and free from all contriving,"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",4,7,KING CLAUDIUS,10,"Will not peruse the foils; so that, with ease,"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",4,7,KING CLAUDIUS,11,"Or with a little shuffling, you may choose"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",4,7,KING CLAUDIUS,12,"A sword unbated, and in a pass of practise"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",4,7,KING CLAUDIUS,13,Requite him for your father.
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",4,7,LAERTES,1,I will do't:
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",4,7,LAERTES,2,"And, for that purpose, I'll anoint my sword."
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",4,7,LAERTES,3,"I bought an unction of a mountebank,"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",4,7,LAERTES,4,"So mortal that, but dip a knife in it,"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",4,7,LAERTES,5,"Where it draws blood no cataplasm so rare,"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",4,7,LAERTES,6,Collected from all simples that have virtue
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",4,7,LAERTES,7,"Under the moon, can save the thing from death"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",4,7,LAERTES,8,That is but scratch'd withal: I'll touch my point
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",4,7,LAERTES,9,"With this contagion, that, if I gall him slightly,"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",4,7,LAERTES,10,It may be death.
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",4,7,KING CLAUDIUS,1,Let's further think of this;
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",4,7,KING CLAUDIUS,2,Weigh what convenience both of time and means
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",4,7,KING CLAUDIUS,3,"May fit us to our shape: if this should fail,"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",4,7,KING CLAUDIUS,4,"And that our drift look through our bad performance,"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",4,7,KING CLAUDIUS,5,'Twere better not assay'd: therefore this project
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",4,7,KING CLAUDIUS,6,"Should have a back or second, that might hold,"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",4,7,KING CLAUDIUS,7,If this should blast in proof. Soft! let me see:
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",4,7,KING CLAUDIUS,8,We'll make a solemn wager on your cunnings: I ha't.
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",4,7,KING CLAUDIUS,9,When in your motion you are hot and dry--
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",4,7,KING CLAUDIUS,10,As make your bouts more violent to that end--
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",4,7,KING CLAUDIUS,11,"And that he calls for drink, I'll have prepared him"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",4,7,KING CLAUDIUS,12,"A chalice for the nonce, whereon but sipping,"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",4,7,KING CLAUDIUS,13,"If he by chance escape your venom'd stuck,"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",4,7,KING CLAUDIUS,14,Our purpose may hold there.
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",4,7,KING CLAUDIUS,15,"How now, sweet queen!"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",4,7,QUEEN GERTRUDE,1,"One woe doth tread upon another's heel,"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",4,7,QUEEN GERTRUDE,2,"So fast they follow; your sister's drown'd, Laertes."
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",4,7,LAERTES,1,"Drown'd! O, where?"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",4,7,QUEEN GERTRUDE,1,"There is a willow grows aslant a brook,"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",4,7,QUEEN GERTRUDE,2,That shows his hoar leaves in the glassy stream;
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",4,7,QUEEN GERTRUDE,3,There with fantastic garlands did she come
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",4,7,QUEEN GERTRUDE,4,"Of crow-flowers, nettles, daisies, and long purples"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",4,7,QUEEN GERTRUDE,5,"That liberal shepherds give a grosser name,"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",4,7,QUEEN GERTRUDE,6,But our cold maids do dead men's fingers call them:
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",4,7,QUEEN GERTRUDE,7,"There, on the pendent boughs her coronet weeds"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",4,7,QUEEN GERTRUDE,8,"Clambering to hang, an envious sliver broke;"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",4,7,QUEEN GERTRUDE,9,When down her weedy trophies and herself
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",4,7,QUEEN GERTRUDE,10,Fell in the weeping brook. Her clothes spread wide;
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",4,7,QUEEN GERTRUDE,11,"And, mermaid-like, awhile they bore her up:"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",4,7,QUEEN GERTRUDE,12,Which time she chanted snatches of old tunes;
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",4,7,QUEEN GERTRUDE,13,"As one incapable of her own distress,"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",4,7,QUEEN GERTRUDE,14,Or like a creature native and indued
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",4,7,QUEEN GERTRUDE,15,Unto that element: but long it could not be
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",4,7,QUEEN GERTRUDE,16,"Till that her garments, heavy with their drink,"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",4,7,QUEEN GERTRUDE,17,Pull'd the poor wretch from her melodious lay
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",4,7,QUEEN GERTRUDE,18,To muddy death.
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",4,7,LAERTES,1,"Alas, then, she is drown'd?"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",4,7,QUEEN GERTRUDE,1,"Drown'd, drown'd."
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",4,7,LAERTES,1,"Too much of water hast thou, poor Ophelia,"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",4,7,LAERTES,2,And therefore I forbid my tears: but yet
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",4,7,LAERTES,3,"It is our trick; nature her custom holds,"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",4,7,LAERTES,4,"Let shame say what it will: when these are gone,"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",4,7,LAERTES,5,"The woman will be out. Adieu, my lord:"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",4,7,LAERTES,6,"I have a speech of fire, that fain would blaze,"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",4,7,LAERTES,7,But that this folly douts it.
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",4,7,KING CLAUDIUS,1,"Let's follow, Gertrude:"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",4,7,KING CLAUDIUS,2,How much I had to do to calm his rage!
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",4,7,KING CLAUDIUS,3,Now fear I this will give it start again;
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",4,7,KING CLAUDIUS,4,Therefore let's follow.
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",5,1,FIRST CLOWN,1,Is she to be buried in Christian burial that
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",5,1,FIRST CLOWN,2,wilfully seeks her own salvation?
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",5,1,SECOND CLOWN,1,I tell thee she is: and therefore make her grave
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",5,1,SECOND CLOWN,2,"straight: the crowner hath sat on her, and finds it"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",5,1,SECOND CLOWN,3,Christian burial.
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",5,1,FIRST CLOWN,1,"How can that be, unless she drowned herself in her"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",5,1,FIRST CLOWN,2,own defence?
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",5,1,SECOND CLOWN,1,"Why, 'tis found so."
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",5,1,FIRST CLOWN,1,It must be 'se offendendo;' it cannot be else. For
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",5,1,FIRST CLOWN,2,"here lies the point:  if I drown myself wittingly,"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",5,1,FIRST CLOWN,3,it argues an act: and an act hath three branches: it
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",5,1,FIRST CLOWN,4,"is, to act, to do, to perform: argal, she drowned"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",5,1,FIRST CLOWN,5,herself wittingly.
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",5,1,SECOND CLOWN,1,"Nay, but hear you, goodman delver,--"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",5,1,FIRST CLOWN,1,Give me leave. Here lies the water; good: here
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",5,1,FIRST CLOWN,2,"stands the man; good; if the man go to this water,"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",5,1,FIRST CLOWN,3,"and drown himself, it is, will he, nill he, he"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",5,1,FIRST CLOWN,4,"goes,--mark you that; but if the water come to him"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",5,1,FIRST CLOWN,5,"and drown him, he drowns not himself: argal, he"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",5,1,FIRST CLOWN,6,that is not guilty of his own death shortens not his own life.
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",5,1,SECOND CLOWN,1,But is this law?
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",5,1,FIRST CLOWN,1,"Ay, marry, is't; crowner's quest law."
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",5,1,SECOND CLOWN,1,Will you ha' the truth on't? If this had not been
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",5,1,SECOND CLOWN,2,"a gentlewoman, she should have been buried out o'"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",5,1,SECOND CLOWN,3,Christian burial.
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",5,1,FIRST CLOWN,1,"Why, there thou say'st: and the more pity that"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",5,1,FIRST CLOWN,2,great folk should have countenance in this world to
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",5,1,FIRST CLOWN,3,"drown or hang themselves, more than their even"

"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",5,1,HAMLET,11,I'll rant as well as thou.
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",5,1,QUEEN GERTRUDE,1,This is mere madness:
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",5,1,QUEEN GERTRUDE,2,And thus awhile the fit will work on him;
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",5,1,QUEEN GERTRUDE,3,"Anon, as patient as the female dove,"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",5,1,QUEEN GERTRUDE,4,"When that her golden couplets are disclosed,"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",5,1,QUEEN GERTRUDE,5,His silence will sit drooping.
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",5,1,HAMLET,1,"Hear you, sir;"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",5,1,HAMLET,2,What is the reason that you use me thus?
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",5,1,HAMLET,3,I loved you ever: but it is no matter;
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",5,1,HAMLET,4,"Let Hercules himself do what he may,"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",5,1,HAMLET,5,The cat will mew and dog will have his day.
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",5,1,KING CLAUDIUS,1,"I pray you, good Horatio, wait upon him."
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",5,1,KING CLAUDIUS,2,Strengthen your patience in our last night's speech;
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",5,1,KING CLAUDIUS,3,We'll put the matter to the present push.
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",5,1,KING CLAUDIUS,4,"Good Gertrude, set some watch over your son."
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",5,1,KING CLAUDIUS,5,This grave shall have a living monument:
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",5,1,KING CLAUDIUS,6,An hour of quiet shortly shall we see;

"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",5,2,HAMLET,1,"So much for this, sir: now shall you see the other;"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",5,2,HAMLET,2,You do remember all the circumstance?
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",5,2,HORATIO,1,"Remember it, my lord?"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",5,2,HAMLET,1,"Sir, in my heart there was a kind of fighting,"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",5,2,HAMLET,2,That would not let me sleep: methought I lay
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",5,2,HAMLET,3,"Worse than the mutines in the bilboes. Rashly,"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",5,2,HAMLET,4,"And praised be rashness for it, let us know,"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",5,2,HAMLET,5,"Our indiscretion sometimes serves us well,"

"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",5,2,HAMLET,8,"Rough-hew them how we will,--"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",5,2,HORATIO,1,That is most certain.

"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",5,2,HAMLET,2,"My sea-gown scarf'd about me, in the dark"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",5,2,HAMLET,3,Groped I to find out them; had my desire.
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",5,2,HAMLET,4,"Finger'd their packet, and in fine withdrew"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",5,2,HAMLET,5,"To mine own room again; making so bold,"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",5,2,HAMLET,6,"My fears forgetting manners, to unseal"

"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",5,2,HAMLET,8,"O royal knavery!--an exact command,"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",5,2,HAMLET,9,Larded with many several sorts of reasons
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",5,2,HAMLET,10,"Importing Denmark's health and England's too,"

"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",5,2,HORATIO,1,Is't possible?
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",5,2,HAMLET,1,Here's the commission: read it at more leisure.
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",5,2,HAMLET,2,But wilt thou hear me how I did proceed?
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",5,2,HORATIO,1,I beseech you.
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",5,2,HAMLET,1,"Being thus be-netted round with villanies,--"

"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",5,2,HAMLET,7,"How to forget that learning, but, sir, now"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",5,2,HAMLET,8,It did me yeoman's service: wilt thou know
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",5,2,HAMLET,9,The effect of what I wrote?
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",5,2,HORATIO,1,"Ay, good my lord."

"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",5,2,HAMLET,1,"Why, man, they did make love to this employment;"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",5,2,HAMLET,2,They are not near my conscience; their defeat

"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",5,2,HORATIO,1,It must be shortly known to him from England
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",5,2,HORATIO,2,What is the issue of the business there.
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",5,2,HAMLET,1,It will be short: the interim is mine;
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",5,2,HAMLET,2,And a man's life's no more than to say 'One.'
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",5,2,HAMLET,3,"But I am very sorry, good Horatio,"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",5,2,HAMLET,4,That to Laertes I forgot myself;

"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",5,2,OSRIC,1,Your lordship is right welcome back to Denmark.
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",5,2,HAMLET,1,"I humbly thank you, sir. Dost know this water-fly?"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",5,2,HORATIO,1,"No, my good lord."
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",5,2,HAMLET,1,Thy state is the more gracious; for 'tis a vice to

"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",5,2,OSRIC,1,"Sweet lord, if your lordship were at leisure, I"

"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",5,2,HAMLET,1,"I will receive it, sir, with all diligence of"

"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",5,2,OSRIC,1,"I thank your lordship, it is very hot."
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",5,2,HAMLET,1,"No, believe me, 'tis very cold; the wind is"

"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",5,2,OSRIC,1,"It is indifferent cold, my lord, indeed."
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",5,2,HAMLET,1,But yet methinks it is very sultry and hot for my

"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",5,2,OSRIC,1,"Exceedingly, my lord; it is very sultry,--as"

"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",5,2,HAMLET,1,"Sir, his definement suffers no perdition in you;"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",5,2,HAMLET,2,"though, I know, to divide him inventorially would"

"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",5,2,HAMLET,1,"The concernancy, sir? why do we wrap the gentleman"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",5,2,HAMLET,2,in our more rawer breath?
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",5,2,OSRIC,1,Sir?
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",5,2,HORATIO,1,Is't not possible to understand in another tongue?
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",5,2,HORATIO,2,"You will do't, sir, really."
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",5,2,HAMLET,1,What imports the nomination of this gentleman?
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",5,2,OSRIC,1,Of Laertes?
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",5,2,HORATIO,1,His purse is empty already; all's golden words are spent.
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",5,2,HAMLET,1,"Of him, sir."
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",5,2,OSRIC,1,I know you are not ignorant--
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",5,2,HAMLET,1,"I would you did, sir; yet, in faith, if you did,"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",5,2,HAMLET,2,"it would not much approve me. Well, sir?"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",5,2,OSRIC,1,You are not ignorant of what excellence Laertes is--
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",5,2,HAMLET,1,"I dare not confess that, lest I should compare with"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",5,2,HAMLET,2,"him in excellence; but, to know a man well, were to"

"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",5,2,HAMLET,1,What's his weapon?
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",5,2,OSRIC,1,Rapier and dagger.
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",5,2,HAMLET,1,"That's two of his weapons: but, well."
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",5,2,OSRIC,1,"The king, sir, hath wagered with him six Barbary"

"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",5,2,HAMLET,1,What call you the carriages?
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",5,2,HORATIO,1,I knew you must be edified by the margent ere you had done.
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",5,2,OSRIC,1,"The carriages, sir, are the hangers."
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",5,2,HAMLET,1,"The phrase would be more german to the matter, if we"

"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",5,2,HAMLET,4,"against six French swords, their assigns, and three"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",5,2,HAMLET,5,liberal-conceited carriages; that's the French bet
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",5,2,HAMLET,6,"against the Danish. Why is this 'imponed,' as you call it?"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",5,2,OSRIC,1,"The king, sir, hath laid, that in a dozen passes"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",5,2,OSRIC,2,"between yourself and him, he shall not exceed you"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",5,2,OSRIC,3,three hits: he hath laid on twelve for nine; and it
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",5,2,OSRIC,4,"would come to immediate trial, if your lordship"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",5,2,OSRIC,5,would vouchsafe the answer.
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",5,2,HAMLET,1,How if I answer 'no'?
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",5,2,OSRIC,1,"I mean, my lord, the opposition of your person in trial."

"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",5,2,OSRIC,1,Shall I re-deliver you e'en so?
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",5,2,HAMLET,1,"To this effect, sir; after what flourish your nature will."
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",5,2,OSRIC,1,I commend my duty to your lordship.
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",5,2,HAMLET,1,"Yours, yours."
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",5,2,HAMLET,2,He does well to commend it himself; there are no

"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",5,2,HORATIO,1,This lapwing runs away with the shell on his head.
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",5,2,HAMLET,1,"He did comply with his dug, before he sucked it."
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",5,2,HAMLET,2,Thus has he--and many more of the same bevy that I

"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",5,2,HAMLET,4,the time and outward habit of encounter; a kind of
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",5,2,HAMLET,5,"yesty collection, which carries them through and"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",5,2,HAMLET,6,through the most fond and winnowed opinions; and do

"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",5,2,HAMLET,1,I am constant to my purpose; they follow the king's

"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",5,2,LORD,1,The king and queen and all are coming down.
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",5,2,HAMLET,1,In happy time.
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",5,2,LORD,1,The queen desires you to use some gentle

"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",5,2,HAMLET,1,She well instructs me.
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",5,2,HORATIO,1,"You will lose this wager, my lord."
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",5,2,HAMLET,1,"I do not think so: since he went into France, I"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",5,2,HAMLET,2,have been in continual practise: I shall win at the

"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",5,2,HORATIO,1,"Nay, good my lord,--"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",5,2,HAMLET,1,It is but foolery; but it is such a kind of

"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",5,2,HAMLET,3,"'tis not to come; if it be not to come, it will be"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",5,2,HAMLET,4,"now; if it be not now, yet it will come: the"

"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",5,2,KING CLAUDIUS,1,"Come, Hamlet, come, and take this hand from me."
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",5,2,HAMLET,1,"Give me your pardon, sir: I've done you wrong;"

"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",5,2,HAMLET,10,"And when he's not himself does wrong Laertes,"

"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",5,2,HAMLET,12,"Who does it, then? His madness: if't be so,"

"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",5,2,QUEEN GERTRUDE,1,"No, no, the drink, the drink,--O my dear Hamlet,--"

"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",5,2,LAERTES,5,Unbated and envenom'd: the foul practise

"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",5,2,HAMLET,1,"Here, thou incestuous, murderous, damned Dane,"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",5,2,HAMLET,2,Drink off this potion. Is thy union here?
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",5,2,HAMLET,3,Follow my mother.
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",5,2,LAERTES,1,He is justly served;

"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",5,2,HAMLET,7,"But let it be. Horatio, I am dead;"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",5,2,HAMLET,8,Thou livest; report me and my cause aright
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",5,2,HAMLET,9,To the unsatisfied.
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",5,2,HORATIO,1,Never believe it:
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",5,2,HORATIO,2,I am more an antique Roman than a Dane:
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",5,2,HORATIO,3,Here's yet some liquor left.
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",5,2,HAMLET,1,"As thou'rt a man,"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",5,2,HAMLET,2,"Give me the cup: let go; by heaven, I'll have't."

"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",5,2,HAMLET,5,If thou didst ever hold me in thy heart
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",5,2,HAMLET,6,"Absent thee from felicity awhile,"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",5,2,HAMLET,7,"And in this harsh world draw thy breath in pain,"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",5,2,HAMLET,8,To tell my story.
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",5,2,HAMLET,9,What warlike noise is this?
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",5,2,OSRIC,1,"Young Fortinbras, with conquest come from Poland,"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",5,2,OSRIC,2,To the ambassadors of England gives
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",5,2,OSRIC,3,This warlike volley.
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",5,2,HAMLET,1,"O, I die, Horatio;"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",5,2,HAMLET,2,The potent poison quite o'er-crows my spirit:
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",5,2,HAMLET,3,I cannot live to hear the news from England;
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",5,2,HAMLET,4,But I do prophesy the election lights
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",5,2,HAMLET,5,On Fortinbras: he has my dying voice;
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",5,2,HAMLET,6,"So tell him, with the occurrents, more and less,"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",5,2,HAMLET,7,Which have solicited. The rest is silence.
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",5,2,HORATIO,1,Now cracks a noble heart. Good night sweet prince:
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",5,2,HORATIO,2,And flights of angels sing thee to thy rest!
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",5,2,HORATIO,3,Why does the drum come hither?
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",5,2,PRINCE FORTINBRAS,1,Where is this sight?
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",5,2,HORATIO,1,What is it ye would see?
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",5,2,HORATIO,2,"If aught of woe or wonder, cease your search."
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",5,2,PRINCE FORTINBRAS,1,"This quarry cries on havoc. O proud death,"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",5,2,PRINCE FORTINBRAS,2,"What feast is toward in thine eternal cell,"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",5,2,PRINCE FORTINBRAS,3,That thou so many princes at a shot
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",5,2,PRINCE FORTINBRAS,4,So bloodily hast struck?
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",5,2,FIRST AMBASSADOR,1,The sight is dismal;
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",5,2,FIRST AMBASSADOR,2,And our affairs from England come too late:
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",5,2,FIRST AMBASSADOR,3,"The ears are senseless that should give us hearing,"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",5,2,FIRST AMBASSADOR,4,"To tell him his commandment is fulfill'd,"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",5,2,FIRST AMBASSADOR,5,That Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are dead:
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",5,2,FIRST AMBASSADOR,6,Where should we have our thanks?
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",5,2,HORATIO,1,"Not from his mouth,"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",5,2,HORATIO,2,Had it the ability of life to thank you:
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",5,2,HORATIO,3,He never gave commandment for their death.
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",5,2,HORATIO,4,"But since, so jump upon this bloody question,"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",5,2,HORATIO,5,"You from the Polack wars, and you from England,"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",5,2,HORATIO,6,Are here arrived give order that these bodies
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",5,2,HORATIO,7,High on a stage be placed to the view;
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",5,2,HORATIO,8,And let me speak to the yet unknowing world
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",5,2,HORATIO,9,How these things came about: so shall you hear
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",5,2,HORATIO,10,"Of carnal, bloody, and unnatural acts,"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",5,2,HORATIO,11,"Of accidental judgments, casual slaughters,"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",5,2,HORATIO,12,"Of deaths put on by cunning and forced cause,"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",5,2,HORATIO,13,"And, in this upshot, purposes mistook"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",5,2,HORATIO,14,Fall'n on the inventors' reads: all this can I
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",5,2,HORATIO,15,Truly deliver.
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",5,2,PRINCE FORTINBRAS,1,"Let us haste to hear it,"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",5,2,PRINCE FORTINBRAS,2,And call the noblest to the audience.
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",5,2,PRINCE FORTINBRAS,3,"For me, with sorrow I embrace my fortune:"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",5,2,PRINCE FORTINBRAS,4,"I have some rights of memory in this kingdom,"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",5,2,PRINCE FORTINBRAS,5,Which now to claim my vantage doth invite me.
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",5,2,HORATIO,1,"Of that I shall have also cause to speak,"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",5,2,HORATIO,2,And from his mouth whose voice will draw on more;
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",5,2,HORATIO,3,"But let this same be presently perform'd,"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",5,2,HORATIO,4,Even while men's minds are wild; lest more mischance
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",5,2,HORATIO,5,"On plots and errors, happen."
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",5,2,PRINCE FORTINBRAS,1,Let four captains
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",5,2,PRINCE FORTINBRAS,2,"Bear Hamlet, like a soldier, to the stage;"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",5,2,PRINCE FORTINBRAS,3,"For he was likely, had he been put on,"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",5,2,PRINCE FORTINBRAS,4,"To have proved most royally: and, for his passage,"
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",5,2,PRINCE FORTINBRAS,5,The soldiers' music and the rites of war
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",5,2,PRINCE FORTINBRAS,6,Speak loudly for him.
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",5,2,PRINCE FORTINBRAS,7,Take up the bodies: such a sight as this
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",5,2,PRINCE FORTINBRAS,8,"Becomes the field, but here shows much amiss."
"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark",5,2,PRINCE FORTINBRAS,9,"Go, bid the soldiers shoot."
