"The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice",2,3,IAGO,2,I had rather have this tongue cut from my mouth

"The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice",2,3,IAGO,6,"Montano and myself being in speech,"
"The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice",2,3,IAGO,7,There comes a fellow crying out for help:
"The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice",2,3,IAGO,8,"And Cassio following him with determined sword,"
"The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice",2,3,IAGO,9,"To execute upon him. Sir, this gentleman"
"The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice",2,3,IAGO,10,"Steps in to Cassio, and entreats his pause:"

"The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice",2,3,IAGO,16,And Cassio high in oath; which till to-night
"The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice",2,3,IAGO,17,I ne'er might say before. When I came back--
"The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice",2,3,IAGO,18,"For this was brief--I found them close together,"
"The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice",2,3,IAGO,19,At blow and thrust; even as again they were
"The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice",2,3,IAGO,20,When you yourself did part them.
"The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice",2,3,IAGO,21,More of this matter cannot I report:
"The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice",2,3,IAGO,22,But men are men; the best sometimes forget:
"The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice",2,3,IAGO,23,"Though Cassio did some little wrong to him,"
"The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice",2,3,IAGO,24,"As men in rage strike those that wish them best,"

"The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice",2,3,IAGO,26,"From him that fled some strange indignity,"
"The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice",2,3,IAGO,27,Which patience could not pass.
"The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice",2,3,OTHELLO,1,"I know, Iago,"
"The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice",2,3,OTHELLO,2,"Thy honesty and love doth mince this matter,"
"The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice",2,3,OTHELLO,3,"Making it light to Cassio. Cassio, I love thee"

"The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice",2,3,OTHELLO,5,"Look, if my gentle love be not raised up!"
"The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice",2,3,OTHELLO,6,I'll make thee an example.
"The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice",2,3,DESDEMONA,1,What's the matter?
"The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice",2,3,OTHELLO,1,"All's well now, sweeting; come away to bed."
"The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice",2,3,OTHELLO,2,"Sir, for your hurts, myself will be your surgeon:"

"The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice",2,3,OTHELLO,4,"Iago, look with care about the town,"

"The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice",2,3,CASSIO,1,"Reputation, reputation, reputation! O, I have lost"
"The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice",2,3,CASSIO,2,my reputation! I have lost the immortal part of

"The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice",2,3,CASSIO,4,"Iago, my reputation!"
"The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice",2,3,IAGO,1,"As I am an honest man, I thought you had received"
"The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice",2,3,IAGO,2,some bodily wound; there is more sense in that than
"The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice",2,3,IAGO,3,in reputation. Reputation is an idle and most false

"The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice",2,3,IAGO,5,"deserving: you have lost no reputation at all,"
"The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice",2,3,IAGO,6,"unless you repute yourself such a loser. What, man!"
"The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice",2,3,IAGO,7,there are ways to recover the general again: you

"The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice",2,3,CASSIO,1,I will rather sue to be despised than to deceive so
"The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice",2,3,CASSIO,2,"good a commander with so slight, so drunken, and so"
"The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice",2,3,CASSIO,3,indiscreet an officer. Drunk? and speak parrot?
"The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice",2,3,CASSIO,4,and squabble? swagger? swear? and discourse
"The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice",2,3,CASSIO,5,fustian with one's own shadow? O thou invisible
"The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice",2,3,CASSIO,6,"spirit of wine, if thou hast no name to be known by,"
"The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice",2,3,CASSIO,7,let us call thee devil!
"The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice",2,3,IAGO,1,What was he that you followed with your sword? What
"The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice",2,3,IAGO,2,had he done to you?
"The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice",2,3,CASSIO,1,I know not.
"The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice",2,3,IAGO,1,Is't possible?
"The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice",2,3,CASSIO,1,"I remember a mass of things, but nothing distinctly;"
"The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice",2,3,CASSIO,2,"a quarrel, but nothing wherefore. O God, that men"
"The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice",2,3,CASSIO,3,should put an enemy in their mouths to steal away
"The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice",2,3,CASSIO,4,"their brains! that we should, with joy, pleasance"
"The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice",2,3,CASSIO,5,"revel and applause, transform ourselves into beasts!"
"The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice",2,3,IAGO,1,"Why, but you are now well enough: how came you thus"
"The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice",2,3,IAGO,2,recovered?
"The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice",2,3,CASSIO,1,It hath pleased the devil drunkenness to give place
"The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice",2,3,CASSIO,2,to the devil wrath; one unperfectness shows me
"The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice",2,3,CASSIO,3,"another, to make me frankly despise myself."
"The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice",2,3,IAGO,1,"Come, you are too severe a moraler: as the time,"
"The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice",2,3,IAGO,2,"the place, and the condition of this country"
"The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice",2,3,IAGO,3,"stands, I could heartily wish this had not befallen;"
"The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice",2,3,IAGO,4,"but, since it is as it is, mend it for your own good."
"The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice",2,3,CASSIO,1,I will ask him for my place again; he shall tell me
"The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice",2,3,CASSIO,2,"I am a drunkard! Had I as many mouths as Hydra,"
"The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice",2,3,CASSIO,3,such an answer would stop them all. To be now a

"The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice",2,3,CASSIO,5,beast! O strange! Every inordinate cup is
"The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice",2,3,CASSIO,6,unblessed and the ingredient is a devil.
"The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice",2,3,IAGO,1,"Come, come, good wine is a good familiar creature,"
"The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice",2,3,IAGO,2,if it be well used: exclaim no more against it.
"The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice",2,3,IAGO,3,"And, good lieutenant, I think you think I love you."
"The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice",2,3,CASSIO,1,"I have well approved it, sir. I drunk!"
"The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice",2,3,IAGO,1,"You or any man living may be drunk! at a time, man."
"The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice",2,3,IAGO,2,I'll tell you what you shall do. Our general's wife
"The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice",2,3,IAGO,3,"is now the general: may say so in this respect, for"

"The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice",2,3,IAGO,9,she holds it a vice in her goodness not to do more
"The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice",2,3,IAGO,10,than she is requested: this broken joint between

"The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice",2,3,IAGO,12,"fortunes against any lay worth naming, this"
"The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice",2,3,IAGO,13,crack of your love shall grow stronger than it was before.
"The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice",2,3,CASSIO,1,You advise me well.
"The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice",2,3,IAGO,1,"I protest, in the sincerity of love and honest kindness."
"The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice",2,3,CASSIO,1,I think it freely; and betimes in the morning I will
"The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice",2,3,CASSIO,2,beseech the virtuous Desdemona to undertake for me:
"The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice",2,3,CASSIO,3,I am desperate of my fortunes if they cheque me here.
"The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice",2,3,IAGO,1,"You are in the right. Good night, lieutenant; I"

"The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice",2,3,CASSIO,1,"Good night, honest Iago."
"The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice",2,3,IAGO,1,And what's he then that says I play the villain?
"The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice",2,3,IAGO,2,"When this advice is free I give and honest,"
"The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice",2,3,IAGO,3,Probal to thinking and indeed the course
"The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice",2,3,IAGO,4,To win the Moor again? For 'tis most easy
"The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice",2,3,IAGO,5,The inclining Desdemona to subdue
"The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice",2,3,IAGO,6,In any honest suit: she's framed as fruitful
"The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice",2,3,IAGO,7,As the free elements. And then for her
"The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice",2,3,IAGO,8,"To win the Moor--were't to renounce his baptism,"
"The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice",2,3,IAGO,9,"All seals and symbols of redeemed sin,"
"The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice",2,3,IAGO,10,"His soul is so enfetter'd to her love,"
"The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice",2,3,IAGO,11,"That she may make, unmake, do what she list,"
"The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice",2,3,IAGO,12,Even as her appetite shall play the god
"The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice",2,3,IAGO,13,With his weak function. How am I then a villain
"The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice",2,3,IAGO,14,"To counsel Cassio to this parallel course,"
"The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice",2,3,IAGO,15,Directly to his good? Divinity of hell!
"The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice",2,3,IAGO,16,"When devils will the blackest sins put on,"
"The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice",2,3,IAGO,17,"They do suggest at first with heavenly shows,"
"The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice",2,3,IAGO,18,As I do now: for whiles this honest fool
"The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice",2,3,IAGO,19,Plies Desdemona to repair his fortunes
"The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice",2,3,IAGO,20,"And she for him pleads strongly to the Moor,"
"The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice",2,3,IAGO,21,"I'll pour this pestilence into his ear,"
"The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice",2,3,IAGO,22,That she repeals him for her body's lust;
"The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice",2,3,IAGO,23,"And by how much she strives to do him good,"
"The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice",2,3,IAGO,24,She shall undo her credit with the Moor.
"The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice",2,3,IAGO,25,"So will I turn her virtue into pitch,"
"The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice",2,3,IAGO,26,And out of her own goodness make the net
"The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice",2,3,IAGO,27,That shall enmesh them all.
"The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice",2,3,IAGO,28,"How now, Roderigo!"
"The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice",2,3,RODERIGO,1,"I do follow here in the chase, not like a hound that"
"The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice",2,3,RODERIGO,2,"hunts, but one that fills up the cry. My money is"
"The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice",2,3,RODERIGO,3,almost spent; I have been to-night exceedingly well
"The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice",2,3,RODERIGO,4,"cudgelled; and I think the issue will be, I shall"
"The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice",2,3,RODERIGO,5,"have so much experience for my pains, and so, with"
"The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice",2,3,RODERIGO,6,"no money at all and a little more wit, return again to Venice."
"The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice",2,3,IAGO,1,How poor are they that have not patience!
"The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice",2,3,IAGO,2,What wound did ever heal but by degrees?
"The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice",2,3,IAGO,3,"Thou know'st we work by wit, and not by witchcraft;"
"The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice",2,3,IAGO,4,And wit depends on dilatory time.
"The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice",2,3,IAGO,5,Does't not go well? Cassio hath beaten thee.
"The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice",2,3,IAGO,6,"And thou, by that small hurt, hast cashier'd Cassio:"
"The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice",2,3,IAGO,7,"Though other things grow fair against the sun,"
"The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice",2,3,IAGO,8,Yet fruits that blossom first will first be ripe:
"The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice",2,3,IAGO,9,"Content thyself awhile. By the mass, 'tis morning;"
"The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice",2,3,IAGO,10,Pleasure and action make the hours seem short.
"The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice",2,3,IAGO,11,Retire thee; go where thou art billeted:
"The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice",2,3,IAGO,12,"Away, I say; thou shalt know more hereafter:"
"The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice",2,3,IAGO,13,"Nay, get thee gone."
"The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice",2,3,IAGO,14,Two things are to be done:
"The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice",2,3,IAGO,15,My wife must move for Cassio to her mistress;
"The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice",2,3,IAGO,16,I'll set her on;
"The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice",2,3,IAGO,17,"Myself the while to draw the Moor apart,"
"The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice",2,3,IAGO,18,And bring him jump when he may Cassio find
"The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice",2,3,IAGO,19,"Soliciting his wife: ay, that's the way"
"The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice",2,3,IAGO,20,Dull not device by coldness and delay.
"The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice",3,1,CASSIO,1,"Masters, play here; I will content your pains;"
"The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice",3,1,CASSIO,2,"Something that's brief; and bid 'Good morrow, general.'"
"The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice",3,1,CLOWN,1,"Why masters, have your instruments been in Naples,"
"The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice",3,1,CLOWN,2,that they speak i' the nose thus?
"The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice",3,1,FIRST MUSICIAN,1,"How, sir, how!"
"The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice",3,1,CLOWN,1,"Are these, I pray you, wind-instruments?"
"The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice",3,1,FIRST MUSICIAN,1,"Ay, marry, are they, sir."
"The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice",3,1,CLOWN,1,"O, thereby hangs a tail."
"The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice",3,1,FIRST MUSICIAN,1,"Whereby hangs a tale, sir?"
"The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice",3,1,CLOWN,1,"Marry. sir, by many a wind-instrument that I know."
"The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice",3,1,CLOWN,2,"But, masters, here's money for you: and the general"
"The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice",3,1,CLOWN,3,"so likes your music, that he desires you, for love's"
"The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice",3,1,CLOWN,4,"sake, to make no more noise with it."
"The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice",3,1,FIRST MUSICIAN,1,"Well, sir, we will not."
"The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice",3,1,CLOWN,1,"If you have any music that may not be heard, to't"
"The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice",3,1,CLOWN,2,"again: but, as they say to hear music the general"
"The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice",3,1,CLOWN,3,does not greatly care.
"The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice",3,1,FIRST MUSICIAN,1,"We have none such, sir."
"The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice",3,1,CLOWN,1,"Then put up your pipes in your bag, for I'll away:"

"The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice",3,1,CASSIO,1,"Prithee, keep up thy quillets. There's a poor piece"

"The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice",3,3,OTHELLO,1,"What dost thou say, Iago?"
"The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice",3,3,IAGO,1,"Did Michael Cassio, when you woo'd my lady,"

"The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice",3,3,IAGO,1,But for a satisfaction of my thought;
"The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice",3,3,IAGO,2,No further harm.
"The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice",3,3,OTHELLO,1,"Why of thy thought, Iago?"
"The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice",3,3,IAGO,1,I did not think he had been acquainted with her.
"The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice",3,3,OTHELLO,1,"O, yes; and went between us very oft."
"The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice",3,3,IAGO,1,Indeed!
"The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice",3,3,OTHELLO,1,"Indeed! ay, indeed: discern'st thou aught in that?"
"The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice",3,3,OTHELLO,2,Is he not honest?
"The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice",3,3,IAGO,1,"Honest, my lord!"
"The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice",3,3,OTHELLO,1,"Honest! ay, honest."
"The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice",3,3,IAGO,1,"My lord, for aught I know."
"The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice",3,3,OTHELLO,1,What dost thou think?
"The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice",3,3,IAGO,1,"Think, my lord!"
"The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice",3,3,OTHELLO,1,"Think, my lord!"
"The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice",3,3,OTHELLO,2,"By heaven, he echoes me,"
"The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice",3,3,OTHELLO,3,As if there were some monster in his thought
"The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice",3,3,OTHELLO,4,Too hideous to be shown. Thou dost mean something:
"The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice",3,3,OTHELLO,5,"I heard thee say even now, thou likedst not that,"
"The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice",3,3,OTHELLO,6,When Cassio left my wife: what didst not like?

"The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice",3,3,OTHELLO,8,"In my whole course of wooing, thou criedst 'Indeed!'"
"The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice",3,3,OTHELLO,9,"And didst contract and purse thy brow together,"

"The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice",3,3,IAGO,1,"My lord, you know I love you."
"The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice",3,3,OTHELLO,1,I think thou dost;
"The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice",3,3,OTHELLO,2,"And, for I know thou'rt full of love and honesty,"
"The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice",3,3,OTHELLO,3,"And weigh'st thy words before thou givest them breath,"
"The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice",3,3,OTHELLO,4,Therefore these stops of thine fright me the more:
"The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice",3,3,OTHELLO,5,For such things in a false disloyal knave
"The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice",3,3,OTHELLO,6,"Are tricks of custom, but in a man that's just"

"The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice",3,3,OTHELLO,3,"As thou dost ruminate, and give thy worst of thoughts"
"The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice",3,3,OTHELLO,4,The worst of words.
"The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice",3,3,IAGO,1,"Good my lord, pardon me:"
"The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice",3,3,IAGO,2,"Though I am bound to every act of duty,"
"The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice",3,3,IAGO,3,I am not bound to that all slaves are free to.

"The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice",3,3,IAGO,9,With meditations lawful?
"The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice",3,3,OTHELLO,1,"Thou dost conspire against thy friend, Iago,"
"The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice",3,3,OTHELLO,2,If thou but think'st him wrong'd and makest his ear

"The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice",3,3,IAGO,1,I do beseech you--
"The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice",3,3,IAGO,2,"Though I perchance am vicious in my guess,"
"The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice",3,3,IAGO,3,"As, I confess, it is my nature's plague"
"The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice",3,3,IAGO,4,"To spy into abuses, and oft my jealousy"
"The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice",3,3,IAGO,5,"Shapes faults that are not--that your wisdom yet,"
"The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice",3,3,IAGO,6,"From one that so imperfectly conceits,"

"The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice",3,3,IAGO,7,And makes me poor indeed.
"The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice",3,3,OTHELLO,1,"By heaven, I'll know thy thoughts."
"The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice",3,3,IAGO,1,"You cannot, if my heart were in your hand;"

"The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice",3,3,OTHELLO,1,Ha!
"The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice",3,3,IAGO,1,"O, beware, my lord, of jealousy;"
"The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice",3,3,IAGO,2,It is the green-eyed monster which doth mock

"The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice",3,4,DESDEMONA,1,"Do you know, sirrah, where Lieutenant Cassio lies?"
"The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice",3,4,CLOWN,1,I dare not say he lies any where.

"The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice",3,4,CLOWN,1,"He's a soldier, and for one to say a soldier lies,"

"The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice",3,4,DESDEMONA,3,"How is't with you, my lord"
"The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice",3,4,OTHELLO,1,"Well, my good lady."
"The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice",3,4,OTHELLO,2,"O, hardness to dissemble!--"
"The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice",3,4,OTHELLO,3,"How do you, Desdemona?"
"The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice",3,4,DESDEMONA,1,"Well, my good lord."

"The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice",3,4,OTHELLO,6,"That commonly rebels. 'Tis a good hand,"
"The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice",3,4,OTHELLO,7,A frank one.
"The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice",3,4,DESDEMONA,1,"You may, indeed, say so;"
"The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice",3,4,DESDEMONA,2,For 'twas that hand that gave away my heart.
"The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice",3,4,OTHELLO,1,A liberal hand: the hearts of old gave hands;
"The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice",3,4,OTHELLO,2,"But our new heraldry is hands, not hearts."
"The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice",3,4,DESDEMONA,1,"I cannot speak of this. Come now, your promise."
"The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice",3,4,OTHELLO,1,"What promise, chuck?"
"The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice",3,4,DESDEMONA,1,I have sent to bid Cassio come speak with you.
"The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice",3,4,OTHELLO,1,I have a salt and sorry rheum offends me;

"The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice",3,4,DESDEMONA,1,"Here, my lord."
"The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice",3,4,OTHELLO,1,That which I gave you.

"The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice",3,4,OTHELLO,1,Not?
"The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice",3,4,DESDEMONA,1,"No, indeed, my lord."
"The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice",3,4,OTHELLO,1,That is a fault.
"The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice",3,4,OTHELLO,2,That handkerchief

"The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice",3,4,OTHELLO,3,"The sun to course two hundred compasses,"

"The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice",3,4,DESDEMONA,1,"I say, it is not lost."
"The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice",3,4,OTHELLO,1,"Fetch't, let me see't."
"The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice",3,4,DESDEMONA,1,"Why, so I can, sir, but I will not now."
"The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice",3,4,DESDEMONA,2,This is a trick to put me from my suit:

"The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice",3,4,OTHELLO,1,Fetch me the handkerchief: my mind misgives.

"The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice",3,4,DESDEMONA,2,"Sure, there's some wonder in this handkerchief:"

"The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice",3,4,CASSIO,1,"Madam, my former suit: I do beseech you"
"The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice",3,4,CASSIO,2,That by your virtuous means I may again

"The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice",3,4,DESDEMONA,1,"Alas, thrice-gentle Cassio!"
"The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice",3,4,DESDEMONA,2,My advocation is not now in tune;

"The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice",3,4,IAGO,1,Is my lord angry?
"The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice",3,4,EMILIA,1,"He went hence but now,"
"The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice",3,4,EMILIA,2,And certainly in strange unquietness.

"The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice",3,4,DESDEMONA,1,"I prithee, do so."
"The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice",3,4,DESDEMONA,2,"Something, sure, of state,"

"The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice",3,4,DESDEMONA,6,"Men's natures wrangle with inferior things,"
"The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice",3,4,DESDEMONA,7,Though great ones are their object. 'Tis even so;

"The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice",3,4,DESDEMONA,1,Alas the day! I never gave him cause.

"The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice",3,4,EMILIA,2,"They are not ever jealous for the cause,"
"The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice",3,4,EMILIA,3,But jealous for they are jealous: 'tis a monster

"The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice",3,4,CASSIO,1,"Pardon me, Bianca:"
"The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice",3,4,CASSIO,2,I have this while with leaden thoughts been press'd:

"The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice",3,4,BIANCA,1,"O Cassio, whence came this?"
"The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice",3,4,BIANCA,2,This is some token from a newer friend:
"The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice",3,4,BIANCA,3,To the felt absence now I feel a cause:

"The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice",3,4,CASSIO,1,"Go to, woman!"
"The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice",3,4,CASSIO,2,"Throw your vile guesses in the devil's teeth,"
"The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice",3,4,CASSIO,3,From whence you have them. You are jealous now
"The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice",3,4,CASSIO,4,"That this is from some mistress, some remembrance:"

"The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice",3,4,BIANCA,1,"Why, whose is it?"
"The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice",3,4,CASSIO,1,"I know not, sweet: I found it in my chamber."

"The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice",3,4,BIANCA,1,Leave you! wherefore?
"The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice",3,4,CASSIO,1,I do attend here on the general;
"The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice",3,4,CASSIO,2,"And think it no addition, nor my wish,"
"The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice",3,4,CASSIO,3,To have him see me woman'd.
"The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice",3,4,BIANCA,1,"Why, I pray you?"
"The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice",3,4,CASSIO,1,Not that I love you not.
"The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice",3,4,BIANCA,1,But that you do not love me.
"The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice",3,4,BIANCA,2,"I pray you, bring me on the way a little,"
"The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice",3,4,BIANCA,3,And say if I shall see you soon at night.

"The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice",4,1,OTHELLO,1,An unauthorized kiss.
"The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice",4,1,IAGO,1,Or to be naked with her friend in bed
"The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice",4,1,IAGO,2,"An hour or more, not meaning any harm?"
"The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice",4,1,OTHELLO,1,"Naked in bed, Iago, and not mean harm!"

"The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice",4,1,OTHELLO,6,Nature would not invest herself in such shadowing

"The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice",4,1,IAGO,1,That's not amiss;

"The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice",4,1,CASSIO,1,She was here even now; she haunts me in every place.
"The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice",4,1,CASSIO,2,I was the other day talking on the sea-bank with

"The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice",4,1,OTHELLO,1,Crying 'O dear Cassio!' as it were: his gesture
"The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice",4,1,OTHELLO,2,imports it.
"The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice",4,1,CASSIO,1,"So hangs, and lolls, and weeps upon me; so hales,"

"The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice",4,2,EMILIA,1,"O, fie upon them! Some such squire he was"
"The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice",4,2,EMILIA,2,"That turn'd your wit the seamy side without,"
"The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice",4,2,EMILIA,3,And made you to suspect me with the Moor.
"The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice",4,2,IAGO,1,You are a fool; go to.
"The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice",4,2,DESDEMONA,1,"O good Iago,"
"The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice",4,2,DESDEMONA,2,What shall I do to win my lord again?
"The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice",4,2,DESDEMONA,3,"Good friend, go to him; for, by this light of heaven,"
"The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice",4,2,DESDEMONA,4,I know not how I lost him. Here I kneel:
"The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice",4,2,DESDEMONA,5,"If e'er my will did trespass 'gainst his love,"
"The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice",4,2,DESDEMONA,6,"Either in discourse of thought or actual deed,"
"The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice",4,2,DESDEMONA,7,"Or that mine eyes, mine ears, or any sense,"
"The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice",4,2,DESDEMONA,8,Delighted them in any other form;
"The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice",4,2,DESDEMONA,9,"Or that I do not yet, and ever did."
"The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice",4,2,DESDEMONA,10,And ever will--though he do shake me off
"The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice",4,2,DESDEMONA,11,"To beggarly divorcement--love him dearly,"
"The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice",4,2,DESDEMONA,12,Comfort forswear me! Unkindness may do much;
"The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice",4,2,DESDEMONA,13,"And his unkindness may defeat my life,"
"The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice",4,2,DESDEMONA,14,But never taint my love. I cannot say 'whore:'
"The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice",4,2,DESDEMONA,15,It does abhor me now I speak the word;
"The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice",4,2,DESDEMONA,16,To do the act that might the addition earn
"The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice",4,2,DESDEMONA,17,Not the world's mass of vanity could make me.
"The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice",4,2,IAGO,1,"I pray you, be content; 'tis but his humour:"
"The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice",4,2,IAGO,2,"The business of the state does him offence,"
"The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice",4,2,IAGO,3,And he does chide with you.
"The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice",4,2,DESDEMONA,1,If 'twere no other--
"The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice",4,2,IAGO,1,"'Tis but so, I warrant."
"The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice",4,2,IAGO,2,"Hark, how these instruments summon to supper!"
"The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice",4,2,IAGO,3,The messengers of Venice stay the meat;
"The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice",4,2,IAGO,4,"Go in, and weep not; all things shall be well."
"The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice",4,2,IAGO,5,"How now, Roderigo!"
"The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice",4,2,RODERIGO,1,I do not find that thou dealest justly with me.
"The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice",4,2,IAGO,1,What in the contrary?
"The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice",4,2,RODERIGO,1,"Every day thou daffest me with some device, Iago;"
"The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice",4,2,RODERIGO,2,"and rather, as it seems to me now, keepest from me"
"The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice",4,2,RODERIGO,3,all conveniency than suppliest me with the least
"The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice",4,2,RODERIGO,4,advantage of hope. I will indeed no longer endure
"The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice",4,2,RODERIGO,5,"it, nor am I yet persuaded to put up in peace what"
"The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice",4,2,RODERIGO,6,already I have foolishly suffered.
"The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice",4,2,IAGO,1,"Will you hear me, Roderigo?"
"The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice",4,2,RODERIGO,1,"'Faith, I have heard too much, for your words and"
"The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice",4,2,RODERIGO,2,performances are no kin together.
"The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice",4,2,IAGO,1,You charge me most unjustly.
"The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice",4,2,RODERIGO,1,With nought but truth. I have wasted myself out of
"The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice",4,2,RODERIGO,2,my means. The jewels you have had from me to
"The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice",4,2,RODERIGO,3,deliver to Desdemona would half have corrupted a
"The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice",4,2,RODERIGO,4,votarist: you have told me she hath received them
"The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice",4,2,RODERIGO,5,and returned me expectations and comforts of sudden
"The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice",4,2,RODERIGO,6,"respect and acquaintance, but I find none."
"The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice",4,2,IAGO,1,Well; go to; very well.
"The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice",4,2,RODERIGO,1,"Very well! go to! I cannot go to, man; nor 'tis"
"The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice",4,2,RODERIGO,2,"not very well: nay, I think it is scurvy, and begin"
"The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice",4,2,RODERIGO,3,to find myself fobbed in it.
"The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice",4,2,IAGO,1,Very well.
"The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice",4,2,RODERIGO,1,I tell you 'tis not very well. I will make myself
"The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice",4,2,RODERIGO,2,known to Desdemona: if she will return me my
"The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice",4,2,RODERIGO,3,"jewels, I will give over my suit and repent my"
"The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice",4,2,RODERIGO,4,"unlawful solicitation; if not, assure yourself I"
"The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice",4,2,RODERIGO,5,will seek satisfaction of you.
"The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice",4,2,IAGO,1,You have said now.
"The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice",4,2,RODERIGO,1,"Ay, and said nothing but what I protest intendment of doing."
"The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice",4,2,IAGO,1,"Why, now I see there's mettle in thee, and even from"
"The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice",4,2,IAGO,2,this instant to build on thee a better opinion than
"The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice",4,2,IAGO,3,"ever before. Give me thy hand, Roderigo: thou hast"
"The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice",4,2,IAGO,4,"taken against me a most just exception; but yet, I"
"The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice",4,2,IAGO,5,"protest, I have dealt most directly in thy affair."
"The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice",4,2,RODERIGO,1,It hath not appeared.
"The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice",4,2,IAGO,1,"I grant indeed it hath not appeared, and your"
"The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice",4,2,IAGO,2,"suspicion is not without wit and judgment. But,"
"The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice",4,2,IAGO,3,"Roderigo, if thou hast that in thee indeed, which I"
"The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice",4,2,IAGO,4,"have greater reason to believe now than ever, I mean"
"The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice",4,2,IAGO,5,"purpose, courage and valour, this night show it: if"
"The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice",4,2,IAGO,6,"thou the next night following enjoy not Desdemona,"
"The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice",4,2,IAGO,7,take me from this world with treachery and devise
"The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice",4,2,IAGO,8,engines for my life.
"The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice",4,2,RODERIGO,1,"Well, what is it? is it within reason and compass?"
"The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice",4,2,IAGO,1,"Sir, there is especial commission come from Venice"
"The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice",4,2,IAGO,2,to depute Cassio in Othello's place.
"The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice",4,2,RODERIGO,1,"Is that true? why, then Othello and Desdemona"
"The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice",4,2,RODERIGO,2,return again to Venice.
"The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice",4,2,IAGO,1,"O, no; he goes into Mauritania and takes away with"
"The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice",4,2,IAGO,2,"him the fair Desdemona, unless his abode be"
"The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice",4,2,IAGO,3,lingered here by some accident: wherein none can be
"The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice",4,2,IAGO,4,so determinate as the removing of Cassio.
"The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice",4,2,RODERIGO,1,"How do you mean, removing of him?"
"The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice",4,2,IAGO,1,"Why, by making him uncapable of Othello's place;"
"The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice",4,2,IAGO,2,knocking out his brains.
"The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice",4,2,RODERIGO,1,And that you would have me to do?
"The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice",4,2,IAGO,1,"Ay, if you dare do yourself a profit and a right."
"The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice",4,2,IAGO,2,"He sups to-night with a harlotry, and thither will I"
"The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice",4,2,IAGO,3,go to him: he knows not yet of his horrorable
"The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice",4,2,IAGO,4,"fortune. If you will watch his going thence, which"
"The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice",4,2,IAGO,5,"I will fashion to fall out between twelve and one,"
"The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice",4,2,IAGO,6,you may take him at your pleasure: I will be near
"The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice",4,2,IAGO,7,"to second your attempt, and he shall fall between"
"The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice",4,2,IAGO,8,"us. Come, stand not amazed at it, but go along with"
"The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice",4,2,IAGO,9,me; I will show you such a necessity in his death
"The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice",4,2,IAGO,10,that you shall think yourself bound to put it on
"The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice",4,2,IAGO,11,"him. It is now high suppertime, and the night grows"
"The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice",4,2,IAGO,12,to waste: about it.
"The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice",4,2,RODERIGO,1,I will hear further reason for this.
"The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice",4,2,IAGO,1,And you shall be satisfied.
"The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice",4,3,LODOVICO,1,"I do beseech you, sir, trouble yourself no further."
"The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice",4,3,OTHELLO,1,"O, pardon me: 'twill do me good to walk."
"The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice",4,3,LODOVICO,1,"Madam, good night; I humbly thank your ladyship."
"The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice",4,3,DESDEMONA,1,Your honour is most welcome.
"The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice",4,3,OTHELLO,1,"Will you walk, sir?"
"The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice",4,3,OTHELLO,2,"O,--Desdemona,--"
"The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice",4,3,DESDEMONA,1,My lord?
"The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice",4,3,OTHELLO,1,Get you to bed on the instant; I will be returned
"The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice",4,3,OTHELLO,2,forthwith: dismiss your attendant there: look it be done.
"The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice",4,3,DESDEMONA,1,"I will, my lord."
"The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice",4,3,EMILIA,1,How goes it now? he looks gentler than he did.
"The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice",4,3,DESDEMONA,1,He says he will return incontinent:
"The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice",4,3,DESDEMONA,2,"He hath commanded me to go to bed,"
"The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice",4,3,DESDEMONA,3,And bade me to dismiss you.
"The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice",4,3,EMILIA,1,Dismiss me!
"The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice",4,3,DESDEMONA,1,"It was his bidding: therefore, good Emilia,."
"The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice",4,3,DESDEMONA,2,"Give me my nightly wearing, and adieu:"
"The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice",4,3,DESDEMONA,3,We must not now displease him.
"The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice",4,3,EMILIA,1,I would you had never seen him!
"The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice",4,3,DESDEMONA,1,"So would not I my love doth so approve him,"
"The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice",4,3,DESDEMONA,2,"That even his stubbornness, his cheques, his frowns--"
"The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice",4,3,DESDEMONA,3,"Prithee, unpin me,--have grace and favour in them."
"The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice",4,3,EMILIA,1,I have laid those sheets you bade me on the bed.
"The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice",4,3,DESDEMONA,1,"All's one. Good faith, how foolish are our minds!"
"The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice",4,3,DESDEMONA,2,"If I do die before thee prithee, shroud me"
"The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice",4,3,DESDEMONA,3,In one of those same sheets.
"The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice",4,3,EMILIA,1,"Come, come you talk."
"The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice",4,3,DESDEMONA,1,My mother had a maid call'd Barbara:
"The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice",4,3,DESDEMONA,2,"She was in love, and he she loved proved mad"
"The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice",4,3,DESDEMONA,3,And did forsake her: she had a song of 'willow;'
"The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice",4,3,DESDEMONA,4,"An old thing 'twas, but it express'd her fortune,"
"The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice",4,3,DESDEMONA,5,And she died singing it: that song to-night
"The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice",4,3,DESDEMONA,6,"Will not go from my mind; I have much to do,"
"The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice",4,3,DESDEMONA,7,"But to go hang my head all at one side,"
"The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice",4,3,DESDEMONA,8,"And sing it like poor Barbara. Prithee, dispatch."
"The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice",4,3,EMILIA,1,Shall I go fetch your night-gown?
"The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice",4,3,DESDEMONA,1,"No, unpin me here."
"The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice",4,3,DESDEMONA,2,This Lodovico is a proper man.
"The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice",4,3,EMILIA,1,A very handsome man.
"The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice",4,3,DESDEMONA,1,He speaks well.
"The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice",4,3,EMILIA,1,I know a lady in Venice would have walked barefoot
"The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice",4,3,EMILIA,2,to Palestine for a touch of his nether lip.
"The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice",4,3,DESDEMONA,1,Sing all a green willow:
"The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice",4,3,DESDEMONA,2,"Her hand on her bosom, her head on her knee,"
"The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice",4,3,DESDEMONA,3,"Sing willow, willow, willow:"
"The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice",4,3,DESDEMONA,4,"The fresh streams ran by her, and murmur'd her moans;"
"The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice",4,3,DESDEMONA,5,"Sing willow, willow, willow;"
"The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice",4,3,DESDEMONA,6,"Her salt tears fell from her, and soften'd the stones;"
"The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice",4,3,DESDEMONA,7,Lay by these:--
"The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice",4,3,DESDEMONA,8,"Sing willow, willow, willow;"
"The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice",4,3,DESDEMONA,9,"Prithee, hie thee; he'll come anon:--"
"The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice",4,3,DESDEMONA,10,Sing all a green willow must be my garland.
"The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice",4,3,DESDEMONA,11,"Let nobody blame him; his scorn I approve,-"
"The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice",4,3,DESDEMONA,12,"Nay, that's not next.--Hark! who is't that knocks?"
"The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice",4,3,EMILIA,1,It's the wind.
"The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice",4,3,DESDEMONA,1,said he then?
"The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice",4,3,DESDEMONA,2,"Sing willow, willow, willow:"
"The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice",4,3,DESDEMONA,3,"If I court moe women, you'll couch with moe men!"
"The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice",4,3,DESDEMONA,4,"So, get thee gone; good night Ate eyes do itch;"
"The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice",4,3,DESDEMONA,5,Doth that bode weeping?
"The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice",4,3,EMILIA,1,'Tis neither here nor there.
"The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice",4,3,DESDEMONA,1,"I have heard it said so. O, these men, these men!"
"The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice",4,3,DESDEMONA,2,"Dost thou in conscience think,--tell me, Emilia,--"
"The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice",4,3,DESDEMONA,3,That there be women do abuse their husbands
"The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice",4,3,DESDEMONA,4,In such gross kind?
"The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice",4,3,EMILIA,1,"There be some such, no question."
"The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice",4,3,DESDEMONA,1,Wouldst thou do such a deed for all the world?
"The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice",4,3,EMILIA,1,"Why, would not you?"
"The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice",4,3,DESDEMONA,1,"No, by this heavenly light!"
"The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice",4,3,EMILIA,1,Nor I neither by this heavenly light;
"The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice",4,3,EMILIA,2,I might do't as well i' the dark.
"The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice",4,3,DESDEMONA,1,Wouldst thou do such a deed for all the world?
"The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice",4,3,EMILIA,1,The world's a huge thing: it is a great price.
"The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice",4,3,EMILIA,2,For a small vice.
"The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice",4,3,DESDEMONA,1,"In troth, I think thou wouldst not."
"The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice",4,3,EMILIA,1,"In troth, I think I should; and undo't when I had"
"The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice",4,3,EMILIA,2,"done. Marry, I would not do such a thing for a"
"The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice",4,3,EMILIA,3,"joint-ring, nor for measures of lawn, nor for"
"The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice",4,3,EMILIA,4,"gowns, petticoats, nor caps, nor any petty"
"The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice",4,3,EMILIA,5,"exhibition; but for the whole world,--why, who would"
"The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice",4,3,EMILIA,6,not make her husband a cuckold to make him a
"The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice",4,3,EMILIA,7,monarch? I should venture purgatory for't.
"The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice",4,3,DESDEMONA,1,"Beshrew me, if I would do such a wrong"
"The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice",4,3,DESDEMONA,2,For the whole world.
"The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice",4,3,EMILIA,1,Why the wrong is but a wrong i' the world: and
"The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice",4,3,EMILIA,2,"having the world for your labour, tis a wrong in your"
"The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice",4,3,EMILIA,3,"own world, and you might quickly make it right."
"The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice",4,3,DESDEMONA,1,I do not think there is any such woman.
"The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice",4,3,EMILIA,1,"Yes, a dozen; and as many to the vantage as would"
"The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice",4,3,EMILIA,2,store the world they played for.
"The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice",4,3,EMILIA,3,But I do think it is their husbands' faults
"The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice",4,3,EMILIA,4,"If wives do fall: say that they slack their duties,"
"The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice",4,3,EMILIA,5,"And pour our treasures into foreign laps,"
"The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice",4,3,EMILIA,6,"Or else break out in peevish jealousies,"
"The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice",4,3,EMILIA,7,"Throwing restraint upon us; or say they strike us,"
"The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice",4,3,EMILIA,8,Or scant our former having in despite;
"The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice",4,3,EMILIA,9,"Why, we have galls, and though we have some grace,"
"The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice",4,3,EMILIA,10,Yet have we some revenge. Let husbands know
"The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice",4,3,EMILIA,11,Their wives have sense like them: they see and smell
"The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice",4,3,EMILIA,12,"And have their palates both for sweet and sour,"
"The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice",4,3,EMILIA,13,As husbands have. What is it that they do
"The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice",4,3,EMILIA,14,When they change us for others? Is it sport?
"The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice",4,3,EMILIA,15,I think it is: and doth affection breed it?
"The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice",4,3,EMILIA,16,I think it doth: is't frailty that thus errs?
"The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice",4,3,EMILIA,17,"It is so too: and have not we affections,"
"The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice",4,3,EMILIA,18,"Desires for sport, and frailty, as men have?"
"The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice",4,3,EMILIA,19,"Then let them use us well: else let them know,"
"The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice",4,3,EMILIA,20,"The ills we do, their ills instruct us so."
"The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice",4,3,DESDEMONA,1,"Good night, good night: heaven me such uses send,"
"The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice",4,3,DESDEMONA,2,"Not to pick bad from bad, but by bad mend!"
"The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice",5,1,IAGO,1,"Here, stand behind this bulk; straight will he come:"
"The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice",5,1,IAGO,2,"Wear thy good rapier bare, and put it home:"
"The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice",5,1,IAGO,3,"Quick, quick; fear nothing; I'll be at thy elbow:"
"The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice",5,1,IAGO,4,"It makes us, or it mars us; think on that,"
"The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice",5,1,IAGO,5,And fix most firm thy resolution.
"The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice",5,1,RODERIGO,1,Be near at hand; I may miscarry in't.
"The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice",5,1,IAGO,1,"Here, at thy hand: be bold, and take thy stand."
"The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice",5,1,RODERIGO,1,I have no great devotion to the deed;
"The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice",5,1,RODERIGO,2,And yet he hath given me satisfying reasons:
"The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice",5,1,RODERIGO,3,"'Tis but a man gone. Forth, my sword: he dies."
"The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice",5,1,IAGO,1,"I have rubb'd this young quat almost to the sense,"
"The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice",5,1,IAGO,2,"And he grows angry. Now, whether he kill Cassio,"
"The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice",5,1,IAGO,3,"Or Cassio him, or each do kill the other,"
"The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice",5,1,IAGO,4,"Every way makes my gain: live Roderigo,"
"The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice",5,1,IAGO,5,He calls me to a restitution large
"The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice",5,1,IAGO,6,"Of gold and jewels that I bobb'd from him,"
"The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice",5,1,IAGO,7,As gifts to Desdemona;
"The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice",5,1,IAGO,8,"It must not be: if Cassio do remain,"
"The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice",5,1,IAGO,9,He hath a daily beauty in his life
"The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice",5,1,IAGO,10,"That makes me ugly; and, besides, the Moor"
"The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice",5,1,IAGO,11,May unfold me to him; there stand I in much peril:
"The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice",5,1,IAGO,12,"No, he must die. But so: I hear him coming."
"The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice",5,1,RODERIGO,1,"I know his gait, 'tis he.--Villain, thou diest!"
"The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice",5,1,CASSIO,1,"That thrust had been mine enemy indeed,"
"The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice",5,1,CASSIO,2,But that my coat is better than thou know'st
"The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice",5,1,CASSIO,3,I will make proof of thine.
"The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice",5,1,RODERIGO,1,"O, I am slain!"
"The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice",5,1,CASSIO,1,"I am maim'd for ever. Help, ho! murder! murder!"
"The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice",5,1,OTHELLO,1,The voice of Cassio: Iago keeps his word.
"The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice",5,1,RODERIGO,1,"O, villain that I am!"
"The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice",5,1,OTHELLO,1,It is even so.
"The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice",5,1,CASSIO,1,"O, help, ho! light! a surgeon!"
"The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice",5,1,OTHELLO,1,"'Tis he:--O brave Iago, honest and just,"
