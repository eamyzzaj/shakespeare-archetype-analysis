The Tragedy of Antony and Cleopatra,1,1,PHILO,104,"Nay, but this dotage of our general's O'erflows the measure: those his goodly eyes, That o'er the files and musters of the war Have glow'd like plated Mars, now bend, now turn, The office and devotion of their view Upon a tawny front: his captain's heart, Which in the scuffles of great fights hath burst The buckles on his breast, reneges all temper, And is become the bellows and the fan To cool a gipsy's lust. Look, where they come: Take but good note, and you shall see in him. The triple pillar of the world transform'd Into a strumpet's fool: behold and see."
The Tragedy of Antony and Cleopatra,1,1,CLEOPATRA,9,"If it be love indeed, tell me how much."

The Tragedy of Antony and Cleopatra,1,1,CLEOPATRA,9,I'll set a bourn how far to be beloved.
The Tragedy of Antony and Cleopatra,1,1,MARK ANTONY,10,"Then must thou needs find out new heaven, new earth."
The Tragedy of Antony and Cleopatra,1,1,ATTENDANT,6,"News, my good lord, from Rome."
The Tragedy of Antony and Cleopatra,1,1,MARK ANTONY,4,Grates me: the sum.
The Tragedy of Antony and Cleopatra,1,1,CLEOPATRA,41,"Nay, hear them, Antony: Fulvia perchance is angry; or, who knows If the scarce-bearded Caesar have not sent His powerful mandate to you, 'Do this, or this; Take in that kingdom, and enfranchise that; Perform 't, or else we damn thee.'"
The Tragedy of Antony and Cleopatra,1,1,MARK ANTONY,3,"How, my love!"
The Tragedy of Antony and Cleopatra,1,1,CLEOPATRA,61,"Perchance! nay, and most like: You must not stay here longer, your dismission Is come from Caesar; therefore hear it, Antony. Where's Fulvia's process? Caesar's I would say? both? Call in the messengers. As I am Egypt's queen, Thou blushest, Antony; and that blood of thine Is Caesar's homager: else so thy cheek pays shame When shrill-tongued Fulvia scolds. The messengers!"
The Tragedy of Antony and Cleopatra,1,1,MARK ANTONY,64,"Let Rome in Tiber melt, and the wide arch Of the ranged empire fall! Here is my space. Kingdoms are clay: our dungy earth alike Feeds beast as man: the nobleness of life Is to do thus; when such a mutual pair And such a twain can do't, in which I bind, On pain of punishment, the world to weet We stand up peerless."
The Tragedy of Antony and Cleopatra,1,1,CLEOPATRA,22,"Excellent falsehood! Why did he marry Fulvia, and not love her? I'll seem the fool I am not; Antony Will be himself."
The Tragedy of Antony and Cleopatra,1,1,MARK ANTONY,38,"But stirr'd by Cleopatra. Now, for the love of Love and her soft hours, Let's not confound the time with conference harsh: There's not a minute of our lives should stretch Without some pleasure now. What sport tonight?"
The Tragedy of Antony and Cleopatra,1,1,CLEOPATRA,3,Hear the ambassadors.
The Tragedy of Antony and Cleopatra,1,1,MARK ANTONY,58,"Fie, wrangling queen! Whom every thing becomes, to chide, to laugh, To weep; whose every passion fully strives To make itself, in thee, fair and admired! No messenger, but thine; and all alone To-night we'll wander through the streets and note The qualities of people. Come, my queen; Last night you did desire it: speak not to us."
The Tragedy of Antony and Cleopatra,1,1,DEMETRIUS,7,Is Caesar with Antonius prized so slight?
The Tragedy of Antony and Cleopatra,1,1,PHILO,21,"Sir, sometimes, when he is not Antony, He comes too short of that great property Which still should go with Antony."
The Tragedy of Antony and Cleopatra,1,1,DEMETRIUS,28,"I am full sorry That he approves the common liar, who Thus speaks of him at Rome: but I will hope Of better deeds to-morrow. Rest you happy!"
The Tragedy of Antony and Cleopatra,1,2,CHARMIAN,37,"Lord Alexas, sweet Alexas, most any thing Alexas, almost most absolute Alexas, where's the soothsayer that you praised so to the queen? O, that I knew this husband, which, you say, must charge his horns with garlands!"

The Tragedy of Antony and Cleopatra,1,2,SOOTHSAYER,8,You shall outlive the lady whom you serve.
The Tragedy of Antony and Cleopatra,1,2,CHARMIAN,9,O excellent! I love long life better than figs.

The Tragedy of Antony and Cleopatra,1,2,IRAS,7,"Go, you wild bedfellow, you cannot soothsay."
The Tragedy of Antony and Cleopatra,1,2,CHARMIAN,22,"Nay, if an oily palm be not a fruitful prognostication, I cannot scratch mine ear. Prithee, tell her but a worky-day fortune."

The Tragedy of Antony and Cleopatra,1,2,IRAS,7,"But how, but how? give me particulars."

The Tragedy of Antony and Cleopatra,1,2,CHARMIAN,73,"Our worser thoughts heavens mend! Alexas,--come, his fortune, his fortune! O, let him marry a woman that cannot go, sweet Isis, I beseech thee! and let her die too, and give him a worse! and let worst follow worse, till the worst of all follow him laughing to his grave, fifty-fold a cuckold! Good Isis, hear me this prayer, though thou deny me a matter of more weight; good Isis, I beseech thee!"
The Tragedy of Antony and Cleopatra,1,2,IRAS,42,"Amen. Dear goddess, hear that prayer of the people! for, as it is a heartbreaking to see a handsome man loose-wived, so it is a deadly sorrow to behold a foul knave uncuckolded: therefore, dear Isis, keep decorum, and fortune him accordingly!"
The Tragedy of Antony and Cleopatra,1,2,CHARMIAN,1,Amen.
The Tragedy of Antony and Cleopatra,1,2,ALEXAS,21,"Lo, now, if it lay in their hands to make me a cuckold, they would make themselves whores, but they'ld do't!"
The Tragedy of Antony and Cleopatra,1,2,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,4,Hush! here comes Antony.
The Tragedy of Antony and Cleopatra,1,2,CHARMIAN,4,Not he; the queen.
The Tragedy of Antony and Cleopatra,1,2,CLEOPATRA,4,Saw you my lord?
The Tragedy of Antony and Cleopatra,1,2,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,2,"No, lady."
The Tragedy of Antony and Cleopatra,1,2,CLEOPATRA,4,Was he not here?
The Tragedy of Antony and Cleopatra,1,2,CHARMIAN,2,"No, madam."
The Tragedy of Antony and Cleopatra,1,2,CLEOPATRA,16,He was disposed to mirth; but on the sudden A Roman thought hath struck him. Enobarbus!
The Tragedy of Antony and Cleopatra,1,2,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,1,Madam?
The Tragedy of Antony and Cleopatra,1,2,CLEOPATRA,8,"Seek him, and bring him hither. Where's Alexas?"
The Tragedy of Antony and Cleopatra,1,2,ALEXAS,7,"Here, at your service. My lord approaches."

The Tragedy of Antony and Cleopatra,1,2,MARK ANTONY,4,Against my brother Lucius?
The Tragedy of Antony and Cleopatra,1,2,MESSENGER,34,"Ay: But soon that war had end, and the time's state Made friends of them, joining their force 'gainst Caesar; Whose better issue in the war, from Italy, Upon the first encounter, drave them."
The Tragedy of Antony and Cleopatra,1,2,MARK ANTONY,3,"Well, what worst?"

The Tragedy of Antony and Cleopatra,1,2,MESSENGER,25,"Labienus-- This is stiff news--hath, with his Parthian force, Extended Asia from Euphrates; His conquering banner shook from Syria To Lydia and to Ionia; Whilst--"
The Tragedy of Antony and Cleopatra,1,2,MARK ANTONY,4,"Antony, thou wouldst say,--"
The Tragedy of Antony and Cleopatra,1,2,MESSENGER,3,"O, my lord!"
The Tragedy of Antony and Cleopatra,1,2,MARK ANTONY,64,"Speak to me home, mince not the general tongue: Name Cleopatra as she is call'd in Rome; Rail thou in Fulvia's phrase; and taunt my faults With such full licence as both truth and malice Have power to utter. O, then we bring forth weeds, When our quick minds lie still; and our ills told us Is as our earing. Fare thee well awhile."
The Tragedy of Antony and Cleopatra,1,2,MESSENGER,4,At your noble pleasure.
The Tragedy of Antony and Cleopatra,1,2,MARK ANTONY,7,"From Sicyon, ho, the news! Speak there!"

The Tragedy of Antony and Cleopatra,1,2,SECOND ATTENDANT,5,He stays upon your will.
The Tragedy of Antony and Cleopatra,1,2,MARK ANTONY,18,"Let him appear. These strong Egyptian fetters I must break, Or lose myself in dotage. What are you?"
The Tragedy of Antony and Cleopatra,1,2,SECOND MESSENGER,5,Fulvia thy wife is dead.
The Tragedy of Antony and Cleopatra,1,2,MARK ANTONY,3,Where died she?
The Tragedy of Antony and Cleopatra,1,2,SECOND MESSENGER,17,"In Sicyon: Her length of sickness, with what else more serious Importeth thee to know, this bears."
The Tragedy of Antony and Cleopatra,1,2,MARK ANTONY,75,"Forbear me. There's a great spirit gone! Thus did I desire it: What our contempt doth often hurl from us, We wish it ours again; the present pleasure, By revolution lowering, does become The opposite of itself: she's good, being gone; The hand could pluck her back that shoved her on. I must from this enchanting queen break off: Ten thousand harms, more than the ills I know, My idleness doth hatch. How now! Enobarbus!"
The Tragedy of Antony and Cleopatra,1,2,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,4,"What's your pleasure, sir?"
The Tragedy of Antony and Cleopatra,1,2,MARK ANTONY,6,I must with haste from hence.
The Tragedy of Antony and Cleopatra,1,2,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,24,"Why, then, we kill all our women: we see how mortal an unkindness is to them; if they suffer our departure, death's the word."
The Tragedy of Antony and Cleopatra,1,2,MARK ANTONY,4,I must be gone.
The Tragedy of Antony and Cleopatra,1,2,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,71,"Under a compelling occasion, let women die; it were pity to cast them away for nothing; though, between them and a great cause, they should be esteemed nothing. Cleopatra, catching but the least noise of this, dies instantly; I have seen her die twenty times upon far poorer moment: I do think there is mettle in death, which commits some loving act upon her, she hath such a celerity in dying."
The Tragedy of Antony and Cleopatra,1,2,MARK ANTONY,6,She is cunning past man's thought.
The Tragedy of Antony and Cleopatra,1,2,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,55,"Alack, sir, no; her passions are made of nothing but the finest part of pure love: we cannot call her winds and waters sighs and tears; they are greater storms and tempests than almanacs can report: this cannot be cunning in her; if it be, she makes a shower of rain as well as Jove."
The Tragedy of Antony and Cleopatra,1,2,MARK ANTONY,6,Would I had never seen her.
The Tragedy of Antony and Cleopatra,1,2,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,24,"O, sir, you had then left unseen a wonderful piece of work; which not to have been blest withal would have discredited your travel."
The Tragedy of Antony and Cleopatra,1,2,MARK ANTONY,3,Fulvia is dead.
The Tragedy of Antony and Cleopatra,1,2,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,1,Sir?
The Tragedy of Antony and Cleopatra,1,2,MARK ANTONY,3,Fulvia is dead.
The Tragedy of Antony and Cleopatra,1,2,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,1,Fulvia!
The Tragedy of Antony and Cleopatra,1,2,MARK ANTONY,1,Dead.
The Tragedy of Antony and Cleopatra,1,2,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,93,"Why, sir, give the gods a thankful sacrifice. When it pleaseth their deities to take the wife of a man from him, it shows to man the tailors of the earth; comforting therein, that when old robes are worn out, there are members to make new. If there were no more women but Fulvia, then had you indeed a cut, and the case to be lamented: this grief is crowned with consolation; your old smock brings forth a new petticoat: and indeed the tears live in an onion that should water this sorrow."
The Tragedy of Antony and Cleopatra,1,2,MARK ANTONY,12,The business she hath broached in the state Cannot endure my absence.
The Tragedy of Antony and Cleopatra,1,2,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,21,"And the business you have broached here cannot be without you; especially that of Cleopatra's, which wholly depends on your abode."
The Tragedy of Antony and Cleopatra,1,2,MARK ANTONY,167,"No more light answers. Let our officers Have notice what we purpose. I shall break The cause of our expedience to the queen, And get her leave to part. For not alone The death of Fulvia, with more urgent touches, Do strongly speak to us; but the letters too Of many our contriving friends in Rome Petition us at home: Sextus Pompeius Hath given the dare to Caesar, and commands The empire of the sea: our slippery people, Whose love is never link'd to the deserver Till his deserts are past, begin to throw Pompey the Great and all his dignities Upon his son; who, high in name and power, Higher than both in blood and life, stands up For the main soldier: whose quality, going on, The sides o' the world may danger: much is breeding, Which, like the courser's hair, hath yet but life, And not a serpent's poison. Say, our pleasure, To such whose place is under us, requires Our quick remove from hence."
The Tragedy of Antony and Cleopatra,1,2,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,3,I shall do't.
The Tragedy of Antony and Cleopatra,1,3,CLEOPATRA,3,Where is he?
The Tragedy of Antony and Cleopatra,1,3,CHARMIAN,6,I did not see him since.
The Tragedy of Antony and Cleopatra,1,3,CLEOPATRA,36,"See where he is, who's with him, what he does: I did not send you: if you find him sad, Say I am dancing; if in mirth, report That I am sudden sick: quick, and return."
The Tragedy of Antony and Cleopatra,1,3,CHARMIAN,20,"Madam, methinks, if you did love him dearly, You do not hold the method to enforce The like from him."
The Tragedy of Antony and Cleopatra,1,3,CLEOPATRA,7,"What should I do, I do not?"
The Tragedy of Antony and Cleopatra,1,3,CHARMIAN,9,"In each thing give him way, cross him nothing."
The Tragedy of Antony and Cleopatra,1,3,CLEOPATRA,10,Thou teachest like a fool; the way to lose him.
The Tragedy of Antony and Cleopatra,1,3,CHARMIAN,22,"Tempt him not so too far; I wish, forbear: In time we hate that which we often fear. But here comes Antony."
The Tragedy of Antony and Cleopatra,1,3,CLEOPATRA,5,I am sick and sullen.
The Tragedy of Antony and Cleopatra,1,3,MARK ANTONY,9,"I am sorry to give breathing to my purpose,--"
The Tragedy of Antony and Cleopatra,1,3,CLEOPATRA,21,"Help me away, dear Charmian; I shall fall: It cannot be thus long, the sides of nature Will not sustain it."
The Tragedy of Antony and Cleopatra,1,3,MARK ANTONY,4,"Now, my dearest queen,--"
The Tragedy of Antony and Cleopatra,1,3,CLEOPATRA,6,"Pray you, stand further from me."
The Tragedy of Antony and Cleopatra,1,3,MARK ANTONY,3,What's the matter?
The Tragedy of Antony and Cleopatra,1,3,CLEOPATRA,46,"I know, by that same eye, there's some good news. What says the married woman? You may go: Would she had never given you leave to come! Let her not say 'tis I that keep you here: I have no power upon you; hers you are."
The Tragedy of Antony and Cleopatra,1,3,MARK ANTONY,4,"The gods best know,--"
The Tragedy of Antony and Cleopatra,1,3,CLEOPATRA,17,"O, never was there queen So mightily betray'd! yet at the first I saw the treasons planted."
The Tragedy of Antony and Cleopatra,1,3,MARK ANTONY,1,"Cleopatra,--"
The Tragedy of Antony and Cleopatra,1,3,CLEOPATRA,38,"Why should I think you can be mine and true, Though you in swearing shake the throned gods, Who have been false to Fulvia? Riotous madness, To be entangled with those mouth-made vows, Which break themselves in swearing!"
The Tragedy of Antony and Cleopatra,1,3,MARK ANTONY,3,"Most sweet queen,--"
The Tragedy of Antony and Cleopatra,1,3,CLEOPATRA,67,"Nay, pray you, seek no colour for your going, But bid farewell, and go: when you sued staying, Then was the time for words: no going then; Eternity was in our lips and eyes, Bliss in our brows' bent; none our parts so poor, But was a race of heaven: they are so still, Or thou, the greatest soldier of the world, Art turn'd the greatest liar."
The Tragedy of Antony and Cleopatra,1,3,MARK ANTONY,3,"How now, lady!"
The Tragedy of Antony and Cleopatra,1,3,CLEOPATRA,15,I would I had thy inches; thou shouldst know There were a heart in Egypt.
The Tragedy of Antony and Cleopatra,1,3,MARK ANTONY,110,"Hear me, queen: The strong necessity of time commands Our services awhile; but my full heart Remains in use with you. Our Italy Shines o'er with civil swords: Sextus Pompeius Makes his approaches to the port of Rome: Equality of two domestic powers Breed scrupulous faction: the hated, grown to strength, Are newly grown to love: the condemn'd Pompey, Rich in his father's honour, creeps apace, Into the hearts of such as have not thrived Upon the present state, whose numbers threaten; And quietness, grown sick of rest, would purge By any desperate change: my more particular, And that which most with you should safe my going, Is Fulvia's death."
The Tragedy of Antony and Cleopatra,1,3,CLEOPATRA,16,"Though age from folly could not give me freedom, It does from childishness: can Fulvia die?"
The Tragedy of Antony and Cleopatra,1,3,MARK ANTONY,26,"She's dead, my queen: Look here, and at thy sovereign leisure read The garboils she awaked; at the last, best: See when and where she died."
The Tragedy of Antony and Cleopatra,1,3,CLEOPATRA,28,"O most false love! Where be the sacred vials thou shouldst fill With sorrowful water? Now I see, I see, In Fulvia's death, how mine received shall be."
The Tragedy of Antony and Cleopatra,1,3,MARK ANTONY,43,"Quarrel no more, but be prepared to know The purposes I bear; which are, or cease, As you shall give the advice. By the fire That quickens Nilus' slime, I go from hence Thy soldier, servant; making peace or war As thou affect'st."
The Tragedy of Antony and Cleopatra,1,3,CLEOPATRA,18,"Cut my lace, Charmian, come; But let it be: I am quickly ill, and well, So Antony loves."
The Tragedy of Antony and Cleopatra,1,3,MARK ANTONY,16,"My precious queen, forbear; And give true evidence to his love, which stands An honourable trial."
The Tragedy of Antony and Cleopatra,1,3,CLEOPATRA,39,"So Fulvia told me. I prithee, turn aside and weep for her, Then bid adieu to me, and say the tears Belong to Egypt: good now, play one scene Of excellent dissembling; and let it look Life perfect honour."
The Tragedy of Antony and Cleopatra,1,3,MARK ANTONY,6,You'll heat my blood: no more.
The Tragedy of Antony and Cleopatra,1,3,CLEOPATRA,9,You can do better yet; but this is meetly.
The Tragedy of Antony and Cleopatra,1,3,MARK ANTONY,4,"Now, by my sword,--"
The Tragedy of Antony and Cleopatra,1,3,CLEOPATRA,25,"And target. Still he mends; But this is not the best. Look, prithee, Charmian, How this Herculean Roman does become The carriage of his chafe."
The Tragedy of Antony and Cleopatra,1,3,MARK ANTONY,4,"I'll leave you, lady."
The Tragedy of Antony and Cleopatra,1,3,CLEOPATRA,45,"Courteous lord, one word. Sir, you and I must part, but that's not it: Sir, you and I have loved, but there's not it; That you know well: something it is I would, O, my oblivion is a very Antony, And I am all forgotten."
The Tragedy of Antony and Cleopatra,1,3,MARK ANTONY,15,"But that your royalty Holds idleness your subject, I should take you For idleness itself."
The Tragedy of Antony and Cleopatra,1,3,CLEOPATRA,64,"'Tis sweating labour To bear such idleness so near the heart As Cleopatra this. But, sir, forgive me; Since my becomings kill me, when they do not Eye well to you: your honour calls you hence; Therefore be deaf to my unpitied folly. And all the gods go with you! upon your sword Sit laurel victory! and smooth success Be strew'd before your feet!"
The Tragedy of Antony and Cleopatra,1,3,MARK ANTONY,27,"Let us go. Come; Our separation so abides, and flies, That thou, residing here, go'st yet with me, And I, hence fleeting, here remain with thee. Away!"
The Tragedy of Antony and Cleopatra,1,4,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,77,"You may see, Lepidus, and henceforth know, It is not Caesar's natural vice to hate Our great competitor: from Alexandria This is the news: he fishes, drinks, and wastes The lamps of night in revel; is not more man-like Than Cleopatra; nor the queen of Ptolemy More womanly than he; hardly gave audience, or Vouchsafed to think he had partners: you shall find there A man who is the abstract of all faults That all men follow."
The Tragedy of Antony and Cleopatra,1,4,LEPIDUS,40,"I must not think there are Evils enow to darken all his goodness: His faults in him seem as the spots of heaven, More fiery by night's blackness; hereditary, Rather than purchased; what he cannot change, Than what he chooses."
The Tragedy of Antony and Cleopatra,1,4,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,150,"You are too indulgent. Let us grant, it is not Amiss to tumble on the bed of Ptolemy; To give a kingdom for a mirth; to sit And keep the turn of tippling with a slave; To reel the streets at noon, and stand the buffet With knaves that smell of sweat: say this becomes him,-- As his composure must be rare indeed Whom these things cannot blemish,--yet must Antony No way excuse his soils, when we do bear So great weight in his lightness. If he fill'd His vacancy with his voluptuousness, Full surfeits, and the dryness of his bones, Call on him for't: but to confound such time, That drums him from his sport, and speaks as loud As his own state and ours,--'tis to be chid As we rate boys, who, being mature in knowledge, Pawn their experience to their present pleasure, And so rebel to judgment."
The Tragedy of Antony and Cleopatra,1,4,LEPIDUS,3,Here's more news.
The Tragedy of Antony and Cleopatra,1,4,MESSENGER,49,"Thy biddings have been done; and every hour, Most noble Caesar, shalt thou have report How 'tis abroad. Pompey is strong at sea; And it appears he is beloved of those That only have fear'd Caesar: to the ports The discontents repair, and men's reports Give him much wrong'd."
The Tragedy of Antony and Cleopatra,1,4,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,63,"I should have known no less. It hath been taught us from the primal state, That he which is was wish'd until he were; And the ebb'd man, ne'er loved till ne'er worth love, Comes dear'd by being lack'd. This common body, Like to a vagabond flag upon the stream, Goes to and back, lackeying the varying tide, To rot itself with motion."
The Tragedy of Antony and Cleopatra,1,4,MESSENGER,66,"Caesar, I bring thee word, Menecrates and Menas, famous pirates, Make the sea serve them, which they ear and wound With keels of every kind: many hot inroads They make in Italy; the borders maritime Lack blood to think on't, and flush youth revolt: No vessel can peep forth, but 'tis as soon Taken as seen; for Pompey's name strikes more Than could his war resisted."
The Tragedy of Antony and Cleopatra,1,4,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,127,"Antony, Leave thy lascivious wassails. When thou once Wast beaten from Modena, where thou slew'st Hirtius and Pansa, consuls, at thy heel Did famine follow; whom thou fought'st against, Though daintily brought up, with patience more Than savages could suffer: thou didst drink The stale of horses, and the gilded puddle Which beasts would cough at: thy palate then did deign The roughest berry on the rudest hedge; Yea, like the stag, when snow the pasture sheets, The barks of trees thou browsed'st; on the Alps It is reported thou didst eat strange flesh, Which some did die to look on: and all this-- It wounds thine honour that I speak it now-- Was borne so like a soldier, that thy cheek So much as lank'd not."
The Tragedy of Antony and Cleopatra,1,4,LEPIDUS,4,'Tis pity of him.
The Tragedy of Antony and Cleopatra,1,4,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,31,Let his shames quickly Drive him to Rome: 'tis time we twain Did show ourselves i' the field; and to that end Assemble we immediate council: Pompey Thrives in our idleness.
The Tragedy of Antony and Cleopatra,1,4,LEPIDUS,25,"To-morrow, Caesar, I shall be furnish'd to inform you rightly Both what by sea and land I can be able To front this present time."
The Tragedy of Antony and Cleopatra,1,4,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,9,"Till which encounter, It is my business too. Farewell."
The Tragedy of Antony and Cleopatra,1,4,LEPIDUS,21,"Farewell, my lord: what you shall know meantime Of stirs abroad, I shall beseech you, sir, To let me be partaker."
The Tragedy of Antony and Cleopatra,1,4,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,9,"Doubt not, sir; I knew it for my bond."
The Tragedy of Antony and Cleopatra,1,5,CLEOPATRA,1,Charmian!
The Tragedy of Antony and Cleopatra,1,5,CHARMIAN,1,Madam?
The Tragedy of Antony and Cleopatra,1,5,CLEOPATRA,7,"Ha, ha! Give me to drink mandragora."

The Tragedy of Antony and Cleopatra,1,5,CLEOPATRA,3,"O, 'tis treason!"
The Tragedy of Antony and Cleopatra,1,5,CHARMIAN,5,"Madam, I trust, not so."
The Tragedy of Antony and Cleopatra,1,5,CLEOPATRA,3,"Thou, eunuch Mardian!"
The Tragedy of Antony and Cleopatra,1,5,MARDIAN,4,What's your highness' pleasure?
The Tragedy of Antony and Cleopatra,1,5,CLEOPATRA,34,"Not now to hear thee sing; I take no pleasure In aught an eunuch has: 'tis well for thee, That, being unseminar'd, thy freer thoughts May not fly forth of Egypt. Hast thou affections?"
The Tragedy of Antony and Cleopatra,1,5,MARDIAN,3,"Yes, gracious madam."
The Tragedy of Antony and Cleopatra,1,5,CLEOPATRA,1,Indeed!
The Tragedy of Antony and Cleopatra,1,5,MARDIAN,29,"Not in deed, madam; for I can do nothing But what indeed is honest to be done: Yet have I fierce affections, and think What Venus did with Mars."
The Tragedy of Antony and Cleopatra,1,5,CLEOPATRA,133,"O Charmian, Where think'st thou he is now? Stands he, or sits he? Or does he walk? or is he on his horse? O happy horse, to bear the weight of Antony! Do bravely, horse! for wot'st thou whom thou movest? The demi-Atlas of this earth, the arm And burgonet of men. He's speaking now, Or murmuring 'Where's my serpent of old Nile?' For so he calls me: now I feed myself With most delicious poison. Think on me, That am with Phoebus' amorous pinches black, And wrinkled deep in time? Broad-fronted Caesar, When thou wast here above the ground, I was A morsel for a monarch: and great Pompey Would stand and make his eyes grow in my brow; There would he anchor his aspect and die With looking on his life."
The Tragedy of Antony and Cleopatra,1,5,ALEXAS,4,"Sovereign of Egypt, hail!"
The Tragedy of Antony and Cleopatra,1,5,CLEOPATRA,28,"How much unlike art thou Mark Antony! Yet, coming from him, that great medicine hath With his tinct gilded thee. How goes it with my brave Mark Antony?"
The Tragedy of Antony and Cleopatra,1,5,ALEXAS,22,"Last thing he did, dear queen, He kiss'd,--the last of many doubled kisses,-- This orient pearl. His speech sticks in my heart."
The Tragedy of Antony and Cleopatra,1,5,CLEOPATRA,6,Mine ear must pluck it thence.
The Tragedy of Antony and Cleopatra,1,5,ALEXAS,67,"'Good friend,' quoth he, 'Say, the firm Roman to great Egypt sends This treasure of an oyster; at whose foot, To mend the petty present, I will piece Her opulent throne with kingdoms; all the east, Say thou, shall call her mistress.' So he nodded, And soberly did mount an arm-gaunt steed, Who neigh'd so high, that what I would have spoke Was beastly dumb'd by him."
The Tragedy of Antony and Cleopatra,1,5,CLEOPATRA,6,"What, was he sad or merry?"
The Tragedy of Antony and Cleopatra,1,5,ALEXAS,20,"Like to the time o' the year between the extremes Of hot and cold, he was nor sad nor merry."
The Tragedy of Antony and Cleopatra,1,5,CLEOPATRA,75,"O well-divided disposition! Note him, Note him good Charmian, 'tis the man; but note him: He was not sad, for he would shine on those That make their looks by his; he was not merry, Which seem'd to tell them his remembrance lay In Egypt with his joy; but between both: O heavenly mingle! Be'st thou sad or merry, The violence of either thee becomes, So does it no man else. Met'st thou my posts?"
The Tragedy of Antony and Cleopatra,1,5,ALEXAS,11,"Ay, madam, twenty several messengers: Why do you send so thick?"
The Tragedy of Antony and Cleopatra,1,5,CLEOPATRA,30,"Who's born that day When I forget to send to Antony, Shall die a beggar. Ink and paper, Charmian. Welcome, my good Alexas. Did I, Charmian, Ever love Caesar so?"
The Tragedy of Antony and Cleopatra,1,5,CHARMIAN,4,O that brave Caesar!
The Tragedy of Antony and Cleopatra,1,5,CLEOPATRA,10,"Be choked with such another emphasis! Say, the brave Antony."

The Tragedy of Antony and Cleopatra,2,1,POMPEY,65,"I shall do well: The people love me, and the sea is mine; My powers are crescent, and my auguring hope Says it will come to the full. Mark Antony In Egypt sits at dinner, and will make No wars without doors: Caesar gets money where He loses hearts: Lepidus flatters both, Of both is flatter'd; but he neither loves, Nor either cares for him."
The Tragedy of Antony and Cleopatra,2,1,MENAS,12,Caesar and Lepidus Are in the field: a mighty strength they carry.
The Tragedy of Antony and Cleopatra,2,1,POMPEY,6,Where have you this? 'tis false.
The Tragedy of Antony and Cleopatra,2,1,MENAS,3,"From Silvius, sir."
The Tragedy of Antony and Cleopatra,2,1,POMPEY,69,"He dreams: I know they are in Rome together, Looking for Antony. But all the charms of love, Salt Cleopatra, soften thy waned lip! Let witchcraft join with beauty, lust with both! Tie up the libertine in a field of feasts, Keep his brain fuming; Epicurean cooks Sharpen with cloyless sauce his appetite; That sleep and feeding may prorogue his honour Even till a Lethe'd dulness! How now, Varrius!"
The Tragedy of Antony and Cleopatra,2,1,VARRIUS,27,This is most certain that I shall deliver: Mark Antony is every hour in Rome Expected: since he went from Egypt 'tis A space for further travel.
The Tragedy of Antony and Cleopatra,2,1,POMPEY,56,"I could have given less matter A better ear. Menas, I did not think This amorous surfeiter would have donn'd his helm For such a petty war: his soldiership Is twice the other twain: but let us rear The higher our opinion, that our stirring Can from the lap of Egypt's widow pluck The ne'er-lust-wearied Antony."
The Tragedy of Antony and Cleopatra,2,1,MENAS,30,"I cannot hope Caesar and Antony shall well greet together: His wife that's dead did trespasses to Caesar; His brother warr'd upon him; although, I think, Not moved by Antony."
The Tragedy of Antony and Cleopatra,2,1,POMPEY,77,"I know not, Menas, How lesser enmities may give way to greater. Were't not that we stand up against them all, 'Twere pregnant they should square between themselves; For they have entertained cause enough To draw their swords: but how the fear of us May cement their divisions and bind up The petty difference, we yet not know. Be't as our gods will have't! It only stands Our lives upon to use our strongest hands. Come, Menas."

The Tragedy of Antony and Cleopatra,2,2,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,38,"I shall entreat him To answer like himself: if Caesar move him, Let Antony look over Caesar's head And speak as loud as Mars. By Jupiter, Were I the wearer of Antonius' beard, I would not shave't to-day."
The Tragedy of Antony and Cleopatra,2,2,LEPIDUS,7,'Tis not a time For private stomaching.

The Tragedy of Antony and Cleopatra,2,2,LEPIDUS,61,"Noble friends, That which combined us was most great, and let not A leaner action rend us.

The Tragedy of Antony and Cleopatra,2,2,MARK ANTONY,15,"'Tis spoken well. Were we before our armies, and to fight. I should do thus."

The Tragedy of Antony and Cleopatra,2,2,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,31,"No more than my residing here at Rome Might be to you in Egypt: yet, if you there Did practise on my state, your being in Egypt Might be my question."
The Tragedy of Antony and Cleopatra,2,2,MARK ANTONY,4,"How intend you, practised?"
The Tragedy of Antony and Cleopatra,2,2,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,36,"You may be pleased to catch at mine intent By what did here befal me. Your wife and brother Made wars upon me; and their contestation Was theme for you, you were the word of war."
The Tragedy of Antony and Cleopatra,2,2,MARK ANTONY,82,"You do mistake your business; my brother never Did urge me in his act: I did inquire it; And have my learning from some true reports, That drew their swords with you. Did he not rather Discredit my authority with yours; And make the wars alike against my stomach, Having alike your cause? Of this my letters Before did satisfy you. If you'll patch a quarrel, As matter whole you have not to make it with, It must not be with this."
The Tragedy of Antony and Cleopatra,2,2,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,16,You praise yourself By laying defects of judgment to me; but You patch'd up your excuses.
The Tragedy of Antony and Cleopatra,2,2,MARK ANTONY,76,"Not so, not so; I know you could not lack, I am certain on't, Very necessity of this thought, that I, Your partner in the cause 'gainst which he fought, Could not with graceful eyes attend those wars Which fronted mine own peace. As for my wife, I would you had her spirit in such another: The third o' the world is yours; which with a snaffle You may pace easy, but not such a wife."

The Tragedy of Antony and Cleopatra,2,2,MARK ANTONY,59,"Sir, He fell upon me ere admitted: then Three kings I had newly feasted, and did want Of what I was i' the morning: but next day I told him of myself; which was as much As to have ask'd him pardon. Let this fellow Be nothing of our strife; if we contend, Out of our question wipe him."
The Tragedy of Antony and Cleopatra,2,2,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,18,You have broken The article of your oath; which you shall never Have tongue to charge me with.
The Tragedy of Antony and Cleopatra,2,2,LEPIDUS,2,"Soft, Caesar!"

The Tragedy of Antony and Cleopatra,2,2,MARK ANTONY,75,"Neglected, rather; And then when poison'd hours had bound me up From mine own knowledge. As nearly as I may, I'll play the penitent to you: but mine honesty Shall not make poor my greatness, nor my power Work without it. Truth is, that Fulvia, To have me out of Egypt, made wars here; For which myself, the ignorant motive, do So far ask pardon as befits mine honour To stoop in such a case."

The Tragedy of Antony and Cleopatra,2,2,AGRIPPA,115,"To hold you in perpetual amity, To make you brothers, and to knit your hearts With an unslipping knot, take Antony Octavia to his wife; whose beauty claims No worse a husband than the best of men; Whose virtue and whose general graces speak That which none else can utter. By this marriage, All little jealousies, which now seem great, And all great fears, which now import their dangers, Would then be nothing: truths would be tales, Where now half tales be truths: her love to both Would, each to other and all loves to both, Draw after her. Pardon what I have spoke; For 'tis a studied, not a present thought, By duty ruminated."

The Tragedy of Antony and Cleopatra,2,2,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,120,"I will tell you. The barge she sat in, like a burnish'd throne, Burn'd on the water: the poop was beaten gold; Purple the sails, and so perfumed that The winds were love-sick with them; the oars were silver, Which to the tune of flutes kept stroke, and made The water which they beat to follow faster, As amorous of their strokes. For her own person, It beggar'd all description: she did lie In her pavilion--cloth-of-gold of tissue-- O'er-picturing that Venus where we see The fancy outwork nature: on each side her Stood pretty dimpled boys, like smiling Cupids, With divers-colour'd fans, whose wind did seem To glow the delicate cheeks which they did cool, And what they undid did."

The Tragedy of Antony and Cleopatra,2,2,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,93,"Her gentlewomen, like the Nereides, So many mermaids, tended her i' the eyes, And made their bends adornings: at the helm A seeming mermaid steers: the silken tackle Swell with the touches of those flower-soft hands, That yarely frame the office. From the barge A strange invisible perfume hits the sense Of the adjacent wharfs. The city cast Her people out upon her; and Antony, Enthroned i' the market-place, did sit alone, Whistling to the air; which, but for vacancy, Had gone to gaze on Cleopatra too, And made a gap in nature."
The Tragedy of Antony and Cleopatra,2,2,AGRIPPA,2,Rare Egyptian!
The Tragedy of Antony and Cleopatra,2,2,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,58,"Upon her landing, Antony sent to her, Invited her to supper: she replied, It should be better he became her guest; Which she entreated: our courteous Antony, Whom ne'er the word of 'No' woman heard speak, Being barber'd ten times o'er, goes to the feast, And for his ordinary pays his heart For what his eyes eat only."

The Tragedy of Antony and Cleopatra,2,2,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,46,"Never; he will not: Age cannot wither her, nor custom stale Her infinite variety: other women cloy The appetites they feed: but she makes hungry Where most she satisfies; for vilest things Become themselves in her: that the holy priests Bless her when she is riggish."

The Tragedy of Antony and Cleopatra,2,3,MARK ANTONY,4,Speak this no more.
The Tragedy of Antony and Cleopatra,2,3,SOOTHSAYER,60,"To none but thee; no more, but when to thee. If thou dost play with him at any game, Thou art sure to lose; and, of that natural luck, He beats thee 'gainst the odds: thy lustre thickens, When he shines by: I say again, thy spirit Is all afraid to govern thee near him; But, he away, 'tis noble."
The Tragedy of Antony and Cleopatra,2,3,MARK ANTONY,103,"Get thee gone: Say to Ventidius I would speak with him: He shall to Parthia. Be it art or hap, He hath spoken true: the very dice obey him; And in our sports my better cunning faints Under his chance: if we draw lots, he speeds; His cocks do win the battle still of mine, When it is all to nought; and his quails ever Beat mine, inhoop'd, at odds. I will to Egypt: And though I make this marriage for my peace, I' the east my pleasure lies. O, come, Ventidius, You must to Parthia: your commission's ready; Follow me, and receive't."

The Tragedy of Antony and Cleopatra,2,5,CLEOPATRA,43,"Well, go to, I will; But there's no goodness in thy face: if Antony Be free and healthful,--so tart a favour To trumpet such good tidings! If not well, Thou shouldst come like a Fury crown'd with snakes, Not like a formal man."
The Tragedy of Antony and Cleopatra,2,5,MESSENGER,5,Will't please you hear me?
The Tragedy of Antony and Cleopatra,2,5,CLEOPATRA,41,"I have a mind to strike thee ere thou speak'st: Yet if thou say Antony lives, is well, Or friends with Caesar, or not captive to him, I'll set thee in a shower of gold, and hail Rich pearls upon thee."
The Tragedy of Antony and Cleopatra,2,5,MESSENGER,3,"Madam, he's well."
The Tragedy of Antony and Cleopatra,2,5,CLEOPATRA,2,Well said.
The Tragedy of Antony and Cleopatra,2,5,MESSENGER,4,And friends with Caesar.
The Tragedy of Antony and Cleopatra,2,5,CLEOPATRA,4,Thou'rt an honest man.

The Tragedy of Antony and Cleopatra,2,5,CLEOPATRA,6,Make thee a fortune from me.
The Tragedy of Antony and Cleopatra,2,5,MESSENGER,3,"But yet, madam,--"
The Tragedy of Antony and Cleopatra,2,5,CLEOPATRA,58,"I do not like 'But yet,' it does allay The good precedence; fie upon 'But yet'! 'But yet' is as a gaoler to bring forth Some monstrous malefactor. Prithee, friend, Pour out the pack of matter to mine ear, The good and bad together: he's friends with Caesar: In state of health thou say'st; and thou say'st free."
The Tragedy of Antony and Cleopatra,2,5,MESSENGER,12,"Free, madam! no; I made no such report: He's bound unto Octavia."
The Tragedy of Antony and Cleopatra,2,5,CLEOPATRA,4,For what good turn?
The Tragedy of Antony and Cleopatra,2,5,MESSENGER,7,For the best turn i' the bed.

The Tragedy of Antony and Cleopatra,2,5,CLEOPATRA,41,"Say 'tis not so, a province I will give thee, And make thy fortunes proud: the blow thou hadst Shall make thy peace for moving me to rage; And I will boot thee with what gift beside Thy modesty can beg."

The Tragedy of Antony and Cleopatra,2,5,CLEOPATRA,59,"I will not hurt him. These hands do lack nobility, that they strike A meaner than myself; since I myself Have given myself the cause. Come hither, sir. Though it be honest, it is never good To bring bad news: give to a gracious message. An host of tongues; but let ill tidings tell Themselves when they be felt."
The Tragedy of Antony and Cleopatra,2,5,MESSENGER,5,I have done my duty.
The Tragedy of Antony and Cleopatra,2,5,CLEOPATRA,16,"Is he married? I cannot hate thee worser than I do, If thou again say 'Yes.'"

The Tragedy of Antony and Cleopatra,2,5,MESSENGER,4,"Should I lie, madam?"
The Tragedy of Antony and Cleopatra,2,5,CLEOPATRA,38,"O, I would thou didst, So half my Egypt were submerged and made A cistern for scaled snakes! Go, get thee hence: Hadst thou Narcissus in thy face, to me Thou wouldst appear most ugly. He is married?"
The Tragedy of Antony and Cleopatra,2,5,MESSENGER,5,I crave your highness' pardon.
The Tragedy of Antony and Cleopatra,2,5,CLEOPATRA,3,He is married?
The Tragedy of Antony and Cleopatra,2,5,MESSENGER,25,Take no offence that I would not offend you: To punish me for what you make me do. Seems much unequal: he's married to Octavia.
The Tragedy of Antony and Cleopatra,2,5,CLEOPATRA,44,"O, that his fault should make a knave of thee, That art not what thou'rt sure of! Get thee hence: The merchandise which thou hast brought from Rome Are all too dear for me: lie they upon thy hand, And be undone by 'em!"

Go to the fellow, good Alexas; bid him Report the feature of Octavia, her years, Her inclination, let him not leave out The colour of her hair: bring me word quickly. Let him for ever go:--let him not--Charmian, Though he be painted one way like a Gorgon, The other way's a Mars. Bid you Alexas Bring me word how tall she is.

The Tragedy of Antony and Cleopatra,2,6,POMPEY,118,"To you all three, The senators alone of this great world, Chief factors for the gods, I do not know Wherefore my father should revengers want, Having a son and friends; since Julius Caesar, Who at Philippi the good Brutus ghosted, There saw you labouring for him. What was't That moved pale Cassius to conspire; and what Made the all-honour'd, honest Roman, Brutus, With the arm'd rest, courtiers and beauteous freedom, To drench the Capitol; but that they would Have one man but a man? And that is it Hath made me rig my navy; at whose burthen The anger'd ocean foams; with which I meant To scourge the ingratitude that despiteful Rome Cast on my noble father."

The Tragedy of Antony and Cleopatra,2,6,MARK ANTONY,3,That's our offer.

The Tragedy of Antony and Cleopatra,2,6,POMPEY,53,"Know, then, I came before you here a man prepared To take this offer: but Mark Antony Put me to some impatience: though I lose The praise of it by telling, you must know, When Caesar and your brother were at blows, Your mother came to Sicily and did find Her welcome friendly."

The Tragedy of Antony and Cleopatra,2,6,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,6,You have done well by water.
The Tragedy of Antony and Cleopatra,2,6,MENAS,4,And you by land.
The Tragedy of Antony and Cleopatra,2,6,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,20,I will praise any man that will praise me; though it cannot be denied what I have done by land.
The Tragedy of Antony and Cleopatra,2,6,MENAS,7,Nor what I have done by water.

The Tragedy of Antony and Cleopatra,2,6,MENAS,9,"True, sir; she was the wife of Caius Marcellus."
The Tragedy of Antony and Cleopatra,2,6,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,9,But she is now the wife of Marcus Antonius.

The Tragedy of Antony and Cleopatra,2,6,MENAS,18,I think the policy of that purpose made more in the marriage than the love of the parties.
The Tragedy of Antony and Cleopatra,2,6,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,34,"I think so too. But you shall find, the band that seems to tie their friendship together will be the very strangler of their amity: Octavia is of a holy, cold, and still conversation."
The Tragedy of Antony and Cleopatra,2,6,MENAS,7,Who would not have his wife so?
The Tragedy of Antony and Cleopatra,2,6,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,65,"Not he that himself is not so; which is Mark Antony. He will to his Egyptian dish again: then shall the sighs of Octavia blow the fire up in Caesar; and, as I said before, that which is the strength of their amity shall prove the immediate author of their variance. Antony will use his affection where it is: he married but his occasion here."
The Tragedy of Antony and Cleopatra,2,6,MENAS,16,"And thus it may be. Come, sir, will you aboard? I have a health for you."
The Tragedy of Antony and Cleopatra,2,6,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,12,"I shall take it, sir: we have used our throats in Egypt."
The Tragedy of Antony and Cleopatra,2,6,MENAS,3,"Come, let's away."
The Tragedy of Antony and Cleopatra,2,7,FIRST SERVANT,21,"Here they'll be, man. Some o' their plants are ill-rooted already: the least wind i' the world will blow them down."

The Tragedy of Antony and Cleopatra,2,7,SECOND SERVANT,23,"As they pinch one another by the disposition, he cries out 'No more;' reconciles them to his entreaty, and himself to the drink."
The Tragedy of Antony and Cleopatra,2,7,FIRST SERVANT,11,But it raises the greater war between him and his discretion.
The Tragedy of Antony and Cleopatra,2,7,SECOND SERVANT,31,"Why, this is to have a name in great men's fellowship: I had as lief have a reed that will do me no service as a partisan I could not heave."
The Tragedy of Antony and Cleopatra,2,7,FIRST SERVANT,27,"To be called into a huge sphere, and not to be seen to move in't, are the holes where eyes should be, which pitifully disaster the cheeks."

The Tragedy of Antony and Cleopatra,2,7,LEPIDUS,18,"Nay, certainly, I have heard the Ptolemies' pyramises are very goodly things; without contradiction, I have heard that."
The Tragedy of Antony and Cleopatra,2,7,POMPEY,2,what is't?
The Tragedy of Antony and Cleopatra,2,7,MENAS,8,"thee, captain, And hear me speak a word."
The Tragedy of Antony and Cleopatra,2,7,POMPEY,4,This wine for Lepidus!
The Tragedy of Antony and Cleopatra,2,7,LEPIDUS,7,What manner o' thing is your crocodile?
The Tragedy of Antony and Cleopatra,2,7,MARK ANTONY,45,"It is shaped, sir, like itself; and it is as broad as it hath breadth: it is just so high as it is, and moves with its own organs: it lives by that which nourisheth it; and the elements once out of it, it transmigrates."
The Tragedy of Antony and Cleopatra,2,7,LEPIDUS,5,What colour is it of?
The Tragedy of Antony and Cleopatra,2,7,MARK ANTONY,5,Of it own colour too.

The Tragedy of Antony and Cleopatra,2,7,MENAS,7,"wilt hear me, Rise from thy stool."
The Tragedy of Antony and Cleopatra,2,7,POMPEY,2,The matter?
The Tragedy of Antony and Cleopatra,2,7,MENAS,10,I have ever held my cap off to thy fortunes.

The Tragedy of Antony and Cleopatra,2,7,MENAS,22,"I'll never follow thy pall'd fortunes more. Who seeks, and will not take when once 'tis offer'd, Shall never find it more."
The Tragedy of Antony and Cleopatra,2,7,POMPEY,4,This health to Lepidus!

In thy fats our cares be drown'd, With thy grapes our hairs be crown'd: Cup us, till the world go round, Cup us, till the world go round!"
The Tragedy of Antony and Cleopatra,2,7,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,65,"What would you more? Pompey, good night. Good brother, Let me request you off: our graver business Frowns at this levity.

The Tragedy of Antony and Cleopatra,3,1,VENTIDIUS,124,"O Silius, Silius, I have done enough; a lower place, note well, May make too great an act: for learn this, Silius; Better to leave undone, than by our deed Acquire too high a fame when him we serve's away. Caesar and Antony have ever won More in their officer than person: Sossius, One of my place in Syria, his lieutenant, For quick accumulation of renown, Which he achieved by the minute, lost his favour. Who does i' the wars more than his captain can Becomes his captain's captain: and ambition, The soldier's virtue, rather makes choice of loss, Than gain which darkens him.

'Tis well thou'rt gone, If it be well to live; but better 'twere Thou fell'st into my fury, for one death Might have prevented many. Eros, ho! The shirt of Nessus is upon me: teach me, Alcides, thou mine ancestor, thy rage: Let me lodge Lichas on the horns o' the moon; And with those hands, that grasp'd the heaviest club, Subdue my worthiest self.

Off, pluck off: The seven-fold shield of Ajax cannot keep The battery from my heart. O, cleave, my sides! Heart, once be stronger than thy continent, Crack thy frail case! Apace, Eros, apace. No more a soldier: bruised pieces, go; You have been nobly borne. From me awhile. I will o'ertake thee, Cleopatra, and Weep for my pardon. So it must be, for now All length is torture: since the torch is out, Lie down, and stray no farther: now all labour Mars what it does; yea, very force entangles Itself with strength: seal then, and all is done. Eros!--I come, my queen:--Eros!--Stay for me: Where souls do couch on flowers, we'll hand in hand, And with our sprightly port make the ghosts gaze: Dido and her AEneas shall want troops, And all the haunt be ours.

Thou art sworn, Eros, That, when the exigent should come, which now Is come indeed, when I should see behind me The inevitable prosecution of Disgrace and horror, that, on my command, Thou then wouldst kill me: do't; the time is come: Thou strikest not me, 'tis Caesar thou defeat'st.

The Tragedy of Antony and Cleopatra,5,1,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,132,"O Antony! I have follow'd thee to this; but we do lance Diseases in our bodies: I must perforce Have shown to thee such a declining day, Or look on thine; we could not stall together In the whole world: but yet let me lament, With tears as sovereign as the blood of hearts, That thou, my brother, my competitor In top of all design, my mate in empire, Friend and companion in the front of war, The arm of mine own body, and the heart Where mine his thoughts did kindle,--that our stars, Unreconciliable, should divide Our equalness to this. Hear me, good friends-- But I will tell you at some meeter season: The business of this man looks out of him; We'll hear him what he says. Whence are you?"

The Tragedy of Antony and Cleopatra,5,1,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,61,"Come hither, Proculeius. Go and say, We purpose her no shame: give her what comforts The quality of her passion shall require, Lest, in her greatness, by some mortal stroke She do defeat us; for her life in Rome Would be eternal in our triumph: go, And with your speediest bring us what she says, And how you find of her."

The Tragedy of Antony and Cleopatra,5,2,CLEOPATRA,59,"My desolation does begin to make A better life. 'Tis paltry to be Caesar; Not being Fortune, he's but Fortune's knave, A minister of her will: and it is great To do that thing that ends all other deeds; Which shackles accidents and bolts up change; Which sleeps, and never palates more the dug, The beggar's nurse and Caesar's."
The Tragedy of Antony and Cleopatra,5,2,PROCULEIUS,23,Caesar sends greeting to the Queen of Egypt; And bids thee study on what fair demands Thou mean'st to have him grant thee.

The Tragedy of Antony and Cleopatra,5,2,CLEOPATRA,77,"Antony Did tell me of you, bade me trust you; but I do not greatly care to be deceived, That have no use for trusting. If your master Would have a queen his beggar, you must tell him, That majesty, to keep decorum, must No less beg than a kingdom: if he please To give me conquer'd Egypt for my son, He gives me so much of mine own, as I Will kneel to him with thanks."
The Tragedy of Antony and Cleopatra,5,2,PROCULEIUS,62,"Be of good cheer; You're fall'n into a princely hand, fear nothing: Make your full reference freely to my lord, Who is so full of grace, that it flows over On all that need: let me report to him Your sweet dependency; and you shall find A conqueror that will pray in aid for kindness, Where he for grace is kneel'd to."

The Tragedy of Antony and Cleopatra,5,2,CLEOPATRA,109,"Sir, I will eat no meat, I'll not drink, sir; If idle talk will once be necessary, I'll not sleep neither: this mortal house I'll ruin, Do Caesar what he can. Know, sir, that I Will not wait pinion'd at your master's court; Nor once be chastised with the sober eye Of dull Octavia. Shall they hoist me up And show me to the shouting varletry Of censuring Rome? Rather a ditch in Egypt Be gentle grave unto me! rather on Nilus' mud Lay me stark naked, and let the water-flies Blow me into abhorring! rather make My country's high pyramides my gibbet, And hang me up in chains!"
The Tragedy of Antony and Cleopatra,5,2,PROCULEIUS,15,You do extend These thoughts of horror further than you shall Find cause in Caesar.
The Tragedy of Antony and Cleopatra,5,2,DOLABELLA,24,"Proculeius, What thou hast done thy master Caesar knows, And he hath sent for thee: for the queen, I'll take her to my guard."

The Tragedy of Antony and Cleopatra,5,2,DOLABELLA,4,Assuredly you know me.
The Tragedy of Antony and Cleopatra,5,2,CLEOPATRA,22,"No matter, sir, what I have heard or known. You laugh when boys or women tell their dreams; Is't not your trick?"

The Tragedy of Antony and Cleopatra,5,2,DOLABELLA,3,"Most sovereign creature,--"
The Tragedy of Antony and Cleopatra,5,2,CLEOPATRA,87,"His legs bestrid the ocean: his rear'd arm Crested the world: his voice was propertied As all the tuned spheres, and that to friends; But when he meant to quail and shake the orb, He was as rattling thunder. For his bounty, There was no winter in't; an autumn 'twas That grew the more by reaping: his delights Were dolphin-like; they show'd his back above The element they lived in: in his livery Walk'd crowns and crownets; realms and islands were As plates dropp'd from his pocket."
The Tragedy of Antony and Cleopatra,5,2,DOLABELLA,1,Cleopatra!
The Tragedy of Antony and Cleopatra,5,2,CLEOPATRA,15,"Think you there was, or might be, such a man As this I dream'd of?"

The Tragedy of Antony and Cleopatra,5,2,CLEOPATRA,46,"You lie, up to the hearing of the gods. But, if there be, or ever were, one such, It's past the size of dreaming: nature wants stuff To vie strange forms with fancy; yet, to imagine And Antony, were nature's piece 'gainst fancy, Condemning shadows quite."
The Tragedy of Antony and Cleopatra,5,2,DOLABELLA,44,"Hear me, good madam. Your loss is as yourself, great; and you bear it As answering to the weight: would I might never O'ertake pursued success, but I do feel, By the rebound of yours, a grief that smites My very heart at root."
The Tragedy of Antony and Cleopatra,5,2,CLEOPATRA,13,"I thank you, sir, Know you what Caesar means to do with me?"

The Tragedy of Antony and Cleopatra,5,2,CLEOPATRA,34,"Sole sir o' the world, I cannot project mine own cause so well To make it clear; but do confess I have Been laden with like frailties which before Have often shamed our sex."
The Tragedy of Antony and Cleopatra,5,2,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,71,"Cleopatra, know, We will extenuate rather than enforce: If you apply yourself to our intents, Which towards you are most gentle, you shall find A benefit in this change; but if you seek To lay on me a cruelty, by taking Antony's course, you shall bereave yourself Of my good purposes, and put your children To that destruction which I'll guard them from, If thereon you rely. I'll take my leave."
The Tragedy of Antony and Cleopatra,5,2,CLEOPATRA,28,"And may, through all the world: 'tis yours; and we, Your scutcheons and your signs of conquest, shall Hang in what place you please. Here, my good lord."

The Tragedy of Antony and Cleopatra,5,2,CLEOPATRA,69,"See, Caesar! O, behold, How pomp is follow'd! mine will now be yours; And, should we shift estates, yours would be mine. The ingratitude of this Seleucus does Even make me wild: O slave, of no more trust Than love that's hired! What, goest thou back? thou shalt Go back, I warrant thee; but I'll catch thine eyes, Though they had wings: slave, soulless villain, dog! O rarely base!"
The Tragedy of Antony and Cleopatra,5,2,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,6,"Good queen, let us entreat you."
The Tragedy of Antony and Cleopatra,5,2,CLEOPATRA,128,"O Caesar, what a wounding shame is this, That thou, vouchsafing here to visit me, Doing the honour of thy lordliness To one so meek, that mine own servant should Parcel the sum of my disgraces by Addition of his envy! Say, good Caesar, That I some lady trifles have reserved, Immoment toys, things of such dignity As we greet modern friends withal; and say, Some nobler token I have kept apart For Livia and Octavia, to induce Their mediation; must I be unfolded With one that I have bred? The gods! it smites me Beneath the fall I have. Prithee, go hence; Or I shall show the cinders of my spirits Through the ashes of my chance: wert thou a man, Thou wouldst have mercy on me."
The Tragedy of Antony and Cleopatra,5,2,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,2,"Forbear, Seleucus."
The Tragedy of Antony and Cleopatra,5,2,CLEOPATRA,30,"Be it known, that we, the greatest, are misthought For things that others do; and, when we fall, We answer others' merits in our name, Are therefore to be pitied."
The Tragedy of Antony and Cleopatra,5,2,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,84,"Cleopatra, Not what you have reserved, nor what acknowledged, Put we i' the roll of conquest: still be't yours, Bestow it at your pleasure; and believe, Caesar's no merchant, to make prize with you Of things that merchants sold. Therefore be cheer'd; Make not your thoughts your prisons: no, dear queen; For we intend so to dispose you as Yourself shall give us counsel. Feed, and sleep: Our care and pity is so much upon you, That we remain your friend; and so, adieu."

The Tragedy of Antony and Cleopatra,5,2,CLEOPATRA,6,"Dolabella, I shall remain your debtor."
The Tragedy of Antony and Cleopatra,5,2,DOLABELLA,11,"I your servant, Adieu, good queen; I must attend on Caesar."
The Tragedy of Antony and Cleopatra,5,2,CLEOPATRA,52,"Farewell, and thanks. Now, Iras, what think'st thou? Thou, an Egyptian puppet, shalt be shown In Rome, as well as I mechanic slaves With greasy aprons, rules, and hammers, shall Uplift us to the view; in their thick breaths, Rank of gross diet, shall be enclouded, And forced to drink their vapour."
The Tragedy of Antony and Cleopatra,5,2,IRAS,3,The gods forbid!
The Tragedy of Antony and Cleopatra,5,2,CLEOPATRA,55,"Nay, 'tis most certain, Iras: saucy lictors Will catch at us, like strumpets; and scald rhymers Ballad us out o' tune: the quick comedians Extemporally will stage us, and present Our Alexandrian revels; Antony Shall be brought drunken forth, and I shall see Some squeaking Cleopatra boy my greatness I' the posture of a whore."
The Tragedy of Antony and Cleopatra,5,2,IRAS,4,O the good gods!
The Tragedy of Antony and Cleopatra,5,2,CLEOPATRA,3,"Nay, that's certain."
The Tragedy of Antony and Cleopatra,5,2,IRAS,15,"I'll never see 't; for, I am sure, my nails Are stronger than mine eyes."
The Tragedy of Antony and Cleopatra,5,2,CLEOPATRA,70,"Why, that's the way To fool their preparation, and to conquer Their most absurd intents. Now, Charmian! Show me, my women, like a queen: go fetch My best attires: I am again for Cydnus, To meet Mark Antony: sirrah Iras, go. Now, noble Charmian, we'll dispatch indeed; And, when thou hast done this chare, I'll give thee leave To play till doomsday. Bring our crown and all. Wherefore's this noise?"
The Tragedy of Antony and Cleopatra,5,2,GUARD,17,Here is a rural fellow That will not be denied your highness presence: He brings you figs.
The Tragedy of Antony and Cleopatra,5,2,CLEOPATRA,45,"Let him come in. What poor an instrument May do a noble deed! he brings me liberty. My resolution's placed, and I have nothing Of woman in me: now from head to foot I am marble-constant; now the fleeting moon No planet is of mine."
The Tragedy of Antony and Cleopatra,5,2,GUARD,4,This is the man.
The Tragedy of Antony and Cleopatra,5,2,CLEOPATRA,17,"Avoid, and leave him. Hast thou the pretty worm of Nilus there, That kills and pains not?"
The Tragedy of Antony and Cleopatra,5,2,CLOWN,34,"Truly, I have him: but I would not be the party that should desire you to touch him, for his biting is immortal; those that do die of it do seldom or never recover."
The Tragedy of Antony and Cleopatra,5,2,CLEOPATRA,7,Rememberest thou any that have died on't?
The Tragedy of Antony and Cleopatra,5,2,CLOWN,87,"Very many, men and women too. I heard of one of them no longer than yesterday: a very honest woman, but something given to lie; as a woman should not do, but in the way of honesty: how she died of the biting of it, what pain she felt: truly, she makes a very good report o' the worm; but he that will believe all that they say, shall never be saved by half that they do: but this is most fallible, the worm's an odd worm."
The Tragedy of Antony and Cleopatra,5,2,CLEOPATRA,4,Get thee hence; farewell.
The Tragedy of Antony and Cleopatra,5,2,CLOWN,8,I wish you all joy of the worm.
The Tragedy of Antony and Cleopatra,5,2,CLEOPATRA,1,Farewell.
The Tragedy of Antony and Cleopatra,5,2,CLOWN,13,"You must think this, look you, that the worm will do his kind."
The Tragedy of Antony and Cleopatra,5,2,CLEOPATRA,3,"Ay, ay; farewell."
The Tragedy of Antony and Cleopatra,5,2,CLOWN,24,"Look you, the worm is not to be trusted but in the keeping of wise people; for, indeed, there is no goodness in worm."
The Tragedy of Antony and Cleopatra,5,2,CLEOPATRA,8,Take thou no care; it shall be heeded.
The Tragedy of Antony and Cleopatra,5,2,CLOWN,15,"Very good. Give it nothing, I pray you, for it is not worth the feeding."
The Tragedy of Antony and Cleopatra,5,2,CLEOPATRA,4,Will it eat me?
The Tragedy of Antony and Cleopatra,5,2,CLOWN,61,"You must not think I am so simple but I know the devil himself will not eat a woman: I know that a woman is a dish for the gods, if the devil dress her not. But, truly, these same whoreson devils do the gods great harm in their women; for in every ten that they make, the devils mar five."
The Tragedy of Antony and Cleopatra,5,2,CLEOPATRA,5,"Well, get thee gone; farewell."
The Tragedy of Antony and Cleopatra,5,2,CLOWN,9,"Yes, forsooth: I wish you joy o' the worm."
The Tragedy of Antony and Cleopatra,5,2,CLEOPATRA,157,"Give me my robe, put on my crown; I have Immortal longings in me: now no more The juice of Egypt's grape shall moist this lip: Yare, yare, good Iras; quick. Methinks I hear Antony call; I see him rouse himself To praise my noble act; I hear him mock The luck of Caesar, which the gods give men To excuse their after wrath: husband, I come: Now to that name my courage prove my title! I am fire and air; my other elements I give to baser life. So; have you done? Come then, and take the last warmth of my lips. Farewell, kind Charmian; Iras, long farewell. Have I the aspic in my lips? Dost fall? If thou and nature can so gently part, The stroke of death is as a lover's pinch, Which hurts, and is desired. Dost thou lie still? If thus thou vanishest, thou tell'st the world It is not worth leave-taking."
The Tragedy of Antony and Cleopatra,5,2,CHARMIAN,14,"Dissolve, thick cloud, and rain; that I may say, The gods themselves do weep!"
The Tragedy of Antony and Cleopatra,5,2,CLEOPATRA,63,"This proves me base: If she first meet the curled Antony, He'll make demand of her, and spend that kiss Which is my heaven to have. Come, thou mortal wretch, With thy sharp teeth this knot intrinsicate Of life at once untie: poor venomous fool Be angry, and dispatch. O, couldst thou speak, That I might hear thee call great Caesar ass Unpolicied!"

The Tragedy of Antony and Cleopatra,5,2,CHARMIAN,42,"In this vile world? So, fare thee well. Now boast thee, death, in thy possession lies A lass unparallel'd. Downy windows, close; And golden Phoebus never be beheld Of eyes again so royal! Your crown's awry; I'll mend it, and then play."
The Tragedy of Antony and Cleopatra,5,2,FIRST GUARD,4,Where is the queen?

The Tragedy of Antony and Cleopatra,5,2,FIRST GUARD,9,"What work is here! Charmian, is this well done?"
The Tragedy of Antony and Cleopatra,5,2,CHARMIAN,17,"It is well done, and fitting for a princess Descended of so many royal kings. Ah, soldier!"
The Tragedy of Antony and Cleopatra,5,2,DOLABELLA,4,How goes it here?
The Tragedy of Antony and Cleopatra,5,2,SECOND GUARD,2,All dead.
The Tragedy of Antony and Cleopatra,5,2,DOLABELLA,23,"Caesar, thy thoughts Touch their effects in this: thyself art coming To see perform'd the dreaded act which thou So sought'st to hinder."

The Tragedy of Antony and Cleopatra,5,2,FIRST GUARD,22,"This is an aspic's trail: and these fig-leaves Have slime upon them, such as the aspic leaves Upon the caves of Nile."
The Tragedy of Antony and Cleopatra,5,2,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,100,"Most probable That so she died; for her physician tells me She hath pursued conclusions infinite Of easy ways to die. Take up her bed; And bear her women from the monument: She shall be buried by her Antony: No grave upon the earth shall clip in it A pair so famous. High events as these Strike those that make them; and their story is No less in pity than his glory which Brought them to be lamented. Our army shall In solemn show attend this funeral; And then to Rome. Come, Dolabella, see High order in this great solemnity."
