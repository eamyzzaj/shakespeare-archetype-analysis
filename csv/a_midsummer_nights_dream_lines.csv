A Midsummer Night's Dream,1,1,THESEUS,1,"Now, fair Hippolyta, our nuptial hour"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,1,1,THESEUS,2,Draws on apace; four happy days bring in
A Midsummer Night's Dream,1,1,THESEUS,3,"Another moon: but, O, methinks, how slow"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,1,1,THESEUS,4,"This old moon wanes! she lingers my desires,"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,1,1,THESEUS,5,Like to a step-dame or a dowager
A Midsummer Night's Dream,1,1,THESEUS,6,Long withering out a young man revenue.
A Midsummer Night's Dream,1,1,HIPPOLYTA,1,Four days will quickly steep themselves in night;
A Midsummer Night's Dream,1,1,HIPPOLYTA,2,Four nights will quickly dream away the time;
A Midsummer Night's Dream,1,1,HIPPOLYTA,3,"And then the moon, like to a silver bow"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,1,1,HIPPOLYTA,4,"New-bent in heaven, shall behold the night"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,1,1,HIPPOLYTA,5,Of our solemnities.
A Midsummer Night's Dream,1,1,THESEUS,1,"Go, Philostrate,"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,1,1,THESEUS,2,Stir up the Athenian youth to merriments;
A Midsummer Night's Dream,1,1,THESEUS,3,Awake the pert and nimble spirit of mirth;
A Midsummer Night's Dream,1,1,THESEUS,4,Turn melancholy forth to funerals;
A Midsummer Night's Dream,1,1,THESEUS,5,The pale companion is not for our pomp.
A Midsummer Night's Dream,1,1,THESEUS,6,"Hippolyta, I woo'd thee with my sword,"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,1,1,THESEUS,7,"And won thy love, doing thee injuries;"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,1,1,THESEUS,8,"But I will wed thee in another key,"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,1,1,THESEUS,9,"With pomp, with triumph and with revelling."
A Midsummer Night's Dream,1,1,EGEUS,1,"Happy be Theseus, our renowned duke!"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,1,1,THESEUS,1,"Thanks, good Egeus: what's the news with thee?"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,1,1,EGEUS,1,"Full of vexation come I, with complaint"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,1,1,EGEUS,2,"Against my child, my daughter Hermia."
A Midsummer Night's Dream,1,1,EGEUS,3,"Stand forth, Demetrius. My noble lord,"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,1,1,EGEUS,4,This man hath my consent to marry her.
A Midsummer Night's Dream,1,1,EGEUS,5,"Stand forth, Lysander: and my gracious duke,"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,1,1,EGEUS,6,This man hath bewitch'd the bosom of my child;
A Midsummer Night's Dream,1,1,EGEUS,7,"Thou, thou, Lysander, thou hast given her rhymes,"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,1,1,EGEUS,8,And interchanged love-tokens with my child:
A Midsummer Night's Dream,1,1,EGEUS,9,"Thou hast by moonlight at her window sung,"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,1,1,EGEUS,10,"With feigning voice verses of feigning love,"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,1,1,EGEUS,11,And stolen the impression of her fantasy
A Midsummer Night's Dream,1,1,EGEUS,12,"With bracelets of thy hair, rings, gawds, conceits,"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,1,1,EGEUS,13,"Knacks, trifles, nosegays, sweetmeats, messengers"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,1,1,EGEUS,14,Of strong prevailment in unharden'd youth:
A Midsummer Night's Dream,1,1,EGEUS,15,"With cunning hast thou filch'd my daughter's heart,"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,1,1,EGEUS,16,"Turn'd her obedience, which is due to me,"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,1,1,EGEUS,17,"To stubborn harshness: and, my gracious duke,"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,1,1,EGEUS,18,Be it so she; will not here before your grace
A Midsummer Night's Dream,1,1,EGEUS,19,"Consent to marry with Demetrius,"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,1,1,EGEUS,20,"I beg the ancient privilege of Athens,"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,1,1,EGEUS,21,"As she is mine, I may dispose of her:"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,1,1,EGEUS,22,Which shall be either to this gentleman
A Midsummer Night's Dream,1,1,EGEUS,23,"Or to her death, according to our law"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,1,1,EGEUS,24,Immediately provided in that case.
A Midsummer Night's Dream,1,1,THESEUS,1,"What say you, Hermia? be advised fair maid:"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,1,1,THESEUS,2,To you your father should be as a god;
A Midsummer Night's Dream,1,1,THESEUS,3,"One that composed your beauties, yea, and one"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,1,1,THESEUS,4,To whom you are but as a form in wax
A Midsummer Night's Dream,1,1,THESEUS,5,By him imprinted and within his power
A Midsummer Night's Dream,1,1,THESEUS,6,To leave the figure or disfigure it.
A Midsummer Night's Dream,1,1,THESEUS,7,Demetrius is a worthy gentleman.
A Midsummer Night's Dream,1,1,HERMIA,1,So is Lysander.
A Midsummer Night's Dream,1,1,THESEUS,1,In himself he is;
A Midsummer Night's Dream,1,1,THESEUS,2,"But in this kind, wanting your father's voice,"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,1,1,THESEUS,3,The other must be held the worthier.
A Midsummer Night's Dream,1,1,HERMIA,1,I would my father look'd but with my eyes.
A Midsummer Night's Dream,1,1,THESEUS,1,Rather your eyes must with his judgment look.
A Midsummer Night's Dream,1,1,HERMIA,1,I do entreat your grace to pardon me.
A Midsummer Night's Dream,1,1,HERMIA,2,"I know not by what power I am made bold,"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,1,1,HERMIA,3,"Nor how it may concern my modesty,"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,1,1,HERMIA,4,In such a presence here to plead my thoughts;
A Midsummer Night's Dream,1,1,HERMIA,5,But I beseech your grace that I may know
A Midsummer Night's Dream,1,1,HERMIA,6,"The worst that may befall me in this case,"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,1,1,HERMIA,7,If I refuse to wed Demetrius.
A Midsummer Night's Dream,1,1,THESEUS,1,Either to die the death or to abjure
A Midsummer Night's Dream,1,1,THESEUS,2,For ever the society of men.
A Midsummer Night's Dream,1,1,THESEUS,3,"Therefore, fair Hermia, question your desires;"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,1,1,THESEUS,4,"Know of your youth, examine well your blood,"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,1,1,THESEUS,5,"Whether, if you yield not to your father's choice,"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,1,1,THESEUS,6,"You can endure the livery of a nun,"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,1,1,THESEUS,7,"For aye to be in shady cloister mew'd,"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,1,1,THESEUS,8,"To live a barren sister all your life,"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,1,1,THESEUS,9,Chanting faint hymns to the cold fruitless moon.
A Midsummer Night's Dream,1,1,THESEUS,10,"Thrice-blessed they that master so their blood,"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,1,1,THESEUS,11,To undergo such maiden pilgrimage;
A Midsummer Night's Dream,1,1,THESEUS,12,"But earthlier happy is the rose distill'd,"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,1,1,THESEUS,13,Than that which withering on the virgin thorn
A Midsummer Night's Dream,1,1,THESEUS,14,"Grows, lives and dies in single blessedness."
A Midsummer Night's Dream,1,1,HERMIA,1,"So will I grow, so live, so die, my lord,"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,1,1,HERMIA,2,Ere I will my virgin patent up
A Midsummer Night's Dream,1,1,HERMIA,3,"Unto his lordship, whose unwished yoke"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,1,1,HERMIA,4,My soul consents not to give sovereignty.
A Midsummer Night's Dream,1,1,THESEUS,1,"Take time to pause; and, by the nest new moon--"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,1,1,THESEUS,2,"The sealing-day betwixt my love and me,"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,1,1,THESEUS,3,For everlasting bond of fellowship--
A Midsummer Night's Dream,1,1,THESEUS,4,Upon that day either prepare to die
A Midsummer Night's Dream,1,1,THESEUS,5,"For disobedience to your father's will,"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,1,1,THESEUS,6,"Or else to wed Demetrius, as he would;"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,1,1,THESEUS,7,Or on Diana's altar to protest
A Midsummer Night's Dream,1,1,THESEUS,8,For aye austerity and single life.
A Midsummer Night's Dream,1,1,DEMETRIUS,1,"Relent, sweet Hermia: and, Lysander, yield"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,1,1,DEMETRIUS,2,Thy crazed title to my certain right.
A Midsummer Night's Dream,1,1,LYSANDER,1,"You have her father's love, Demetrius;"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,1,1,LYSANDER,2,Let me have Hermia's: do you marry him.
A Midsummer Night's Dream,1,1,EGEUS,1,"Scornful Lysander! true, he hath my love,"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,1,1,EGEUS,2,And what is mine my love shall render him.
A Midsummer Night's Dream,1,1,EGEUS,3,"And she is mine, and all my right of her"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,1,1,EGEUS,4,I do estate unto Demetrius.
A Midsummer Night's Dream,1,1,LYSANDER,1,"I am, my lord, as well derived as he,"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,1,1,LYSANDER,2,As well possess'd; my love is more than his;
A Midsummer Night's Dream,1,1,LYSANDER,3,"My fortunes every way as fairly rank'd,"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,1,1,LYSANDER,4,"If not with vantage, as Demetrius';"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,1,1,LYSANDER,5,"And, which is more than all these boasts can be,"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,1,1,LYSANDER,6,I am beloved of beauteous Hermia:
A Midsummer Night's Dream,1,1,LYSANDER,7,Why should not I then prosecute my right?
A Midsummer Night's Dream,1,1,LYSANDER,8,"Demetrius, I'll avouch it to his head,"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,1,1,LYSANDER,9,"Made love to Nedar's daughter, Helena,"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,1,1,LYSANDER,10,"And won her soul; and she, sweet lady, dotes,"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,1,1,LYSANDER,11,"Devoutly dotes, dotes in idolatry,"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,1,1,LYSANDER,12,Upon this spotted and inconstant man.
A Midsummer Night's Dream,1,1,THESEUS,1,"I must confess that I have heard so much,"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,1,1,THESEUS,2,And with Demetrius thought to have spoke thereof;
A Midsummer Night's Dream,1,1,THESEUS,3,"But, being over-full of self-affairs,"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,1,1,THESEUS,4,"My mind did lose it. But, Demetrius, come;"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,1,1,THESEUS,5,"And come, Egeus; you shall go with me,"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,1,1,THESEUS,6,I have some private schooling for you both.
A Midsummer Night's Dream,1,1,THESEUS,7,"For you, fair Hermia, look you arm yourself"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,1,1,THESEUS,8,To fit your fancies to your father's will;
A Midsummer Night's Dream,1,1,THESEUS,9,Or else the law of Athens yields you up--
A Midsummer Night's Dream,1,1,THESEUS,10,Which by no means we may extenuate--
A Midsummer Night's Dream,1,1,THESEUS,11,"To death, or to a vow of single life."
A Midsummer Night's Dream,1,1,THESEUS,12,"Come, my Hippolyta: what cheer, my love?"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,1,1,THESEUS,13,"Demetrius and Egeus, go along:"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,1,1,THESEUS,14,I must employ you in some business
A Midsummer Night's Dream,1,1,THESEUS,15,Against our nuptial and confer with you
A Midsummer Night's Dream,1,1,THESEUS,16,Of something nearly that concerns yourselves.
A Midsummer Night's Dream,1,1,EGEUS,1,With duty and desire we follow you.
A Midsummer Night's Dream,1,1,LYSANDER,1,"How now, my love! why is your cheek so pale?"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,1,1,LYSANDER,2,How chance the roses there do fade so fast?
A Midsummer Night's Dream,1,1,HERMIA,1,"Belike for want of rain, which I could well"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,1,1,HERMIA,2,Beteem them from the tempest of my eyes.
A Midsummer Night's Dream,1,1,LYSANDER,1,"Ay me! for aught that I could ever read,"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,1,1,LYSANDER,2,"Could ever hear by tale or history,"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,1,1,LYSANDER,3,The course of true love never did run smooth;
A Midsummer Night's Dream,1,1,LYSANDER,4,"But, either it was different in blood,--"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,1,1,HERMIA,1,O cross! too high to be enthrall'd to low.
A Midsummer Night's Dream,1,1,LYSANDER,1,"Or else misgraffed in respect of years,--"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,1,1,HERMIA,1,O spite! too old to be engaged to young.
A Midsummer Night's Dream,1,1,LYSANDER,1,"Or else it stood upon the choice of friends,--"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,1,1,HERMIA,1,O hell! to choose love by another's eyes.
A Midsummer Night's Dream,1,1,LYSANDER,1,"Or, if there were a sympathy in choice,"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,1,1,LYSANDER,2,"War, death, or sickness did lay siege to it,"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,1,1,LYSANDER,3,"Making it momentany as a sound,"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,1,1,LYSANDER,4,"Swift as a shadow, short as any dream;"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,1,1,LYSANDER,5,"Brief as the lightning in the collied night,"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,1,1,LYSANDER,6,"That, in a spleen, unfolds both heaven and earth,"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,1,1,LYSANDER,7,And ere a man hath power to say 'Behold!'
A Midsummer Night's Dream,1,1,LYSANDER,8,The jaws of darkness do devour it up:
A Midsummer Night's Dream,1,1,LYSANDER,9,So quick bright things come to confusion.
A Midsummer Night's Dream,1,1,HERMIA,1,"If then true lovers have been ever cross'd,"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,1,1,HERMIA,2,It stands as an edict in destiny:
A Midsummer Night's Dream,1,1,HERMIA,3,"Then let us teach our trial patience,"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,1,1,HERMIA,4,"Because it is a customary cross,"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,1,1,HERMIA,5,"As due to love as thoughts and dreams and sighs,"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,1,1,HERMIA,6,"Wishes and tears, poor fancy's followers."
A Midsummer Night's Dream,1,1,LYSANDER,1,"A good persuasion: therefore, hear me, Hermia."
A Midsummer Night's Dream,1,1,LYSANDER,2,"I have a widow aunt, a dowager"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,1,1,LYSANDER,3,"Of great revenue, and she hath no child:"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,1,1,LYSANDER,4,From Athens is her house remote seven leagues;
A Midsummer Night's Dream,1,1,LYSANDER,5,And she respects me as her only son.
A Midsummer Night's Dream,1,1,LYSANDER,6,"There, gentle Hermia, may I marry thee;"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,1,1,LYSANDER,7,And to that place the sharp Athenian law
A Midsummer Night's Dream,1,1,LYSANDER,8,"Cannot pursue us. If thou lovest me then,"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,1,1,LYSANDER,9,Steal forth thy father's house to-morrow night;
A Midsummer Night's Dream,1,1,LYSANDER,10,"And in the wood, a league without the town,"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,1,1,LYSANDER,11,"Where I did meet thee once with Helena,"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,1,1,LYSANDER,12,"To do observance to a morn of May,"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,1,1,LYSANDER,13,There will I stay for thee.
A Midsummer Night's Dream,1,1,HERMIA,1,My good Lysander!
A Midsummer Night's Dream,1,1,HERMIA,2,"I swear to thee, by Cupid's strongest bow,"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,1,1,HERMIA,3,"By his best arrow with the golden head,"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,1,1,HERMIA,4,"By the simplicity of Venus' doves,"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,1,1,HERMIA,5,"By that which knitteth souls and prospers loves,"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,1,1,HERMIA,6,"And by that fire which burn'd the Carthage queen,"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,1,1,HERMIA,7,"When the false Troyan under sail was seen,"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,1,1,HERMIA,8,"By all the vows that ever men have broke,"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,1,1,HERMIA,9,"In number more than ever women spoke,"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,1,1,HERMIA,10,"In that same place thou hast appointed me,"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,1,1,HERMIA,11,To-morrow truly will I meet with thee.
A Midsummer Night's Dream,1,1,LYSANDER,1,"Keep promise, love. Look, here comes Helena."
A Midsummer Night's Dream,1,1,HERMIA,1,God speed fair Helena! whither away?
A Midsummer Night's Dream,1,1,HELENA,1,Call you me fair? that fair again unsay.
A Midsummer Night's Dream,1,1,HELENA,2,Demetrius loves your fair: O happy fair!
A Midsummer Night's Dream,1,1,HELENA,3,Your eyes are lode-stars; and your tongue's sweet air
A Midsummer Night's Dream,1,1,HELENA,4,"More tuneable than lark to shepherd's ear,"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,1,1,HELENA,5,"When wheat is green, when hawthorn buds appear."
A Midsummer Night's Dream,1,1,HELENA,6,"Sickness is catching: O, were favour so,"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,1,1,HELENA,7,"Yours would I catch, fair Hermia, ere I go;"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,1,1,HELENA,8,"My ear should catch your voice, my eye your eye,"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,1,1,HELENA,9,My tongue should catch your tongue's sweet melody.
A Midsummer Night's Dream,1,1,HELENA,10,"Were the world mine, Demetrius being bated,"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,1,1,HELENA,11,The rest I'd give to be to you translated.
A Midsummer Night's Dream,1,1,HELENA,12,"O, teach me how you look, and with what art"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,1,1,HELENA,13,You sway the motion of Demetrius' heart.
A Midsummer Night's Dream,1,1,HERMIA,1,"I frown upon him, yet he loves me still."
A Midsummer Night's Dream,1,1,HELENA,1,O that your frowns would teach my smiles such skill!
A Midsummer Night's Dream,1,1,HERMIA,1,"I give him curses, yet he gives me love."
A Midsummer Night's Dream,1,1,HELENA,1,O that my prayers could such affection move!
A Midsummer Night's Dream,1,1,HERMIA,1,"The more I hate, the more he follows me."
A Midsummer Night's Dream,1,1,HELENA,1,"The more I love, the more he hateth me."
A Midsummer Night's Dream,1,1,HERMIA,1,"His folly, Helena, is no fault of mine."
A Midsummer Night's Dream,1,1,HELENA,1,"None, but your beauty: would that fault were mine!"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,1,1,HERMIA,1,Take comfort: he no more shall see my face;
A Midsummer Night's Dream,1,1,HERMIA,2,Lysander and myself will fly this place.
A Midsummer Night's Dream,1,1,HERMIA,3,"Before the time I did Lysander see,"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,1,1,HERMIA,4,Seem'd Athens as a paradise to me:
A Midsummer Night's Dream,1,1,HERMIA,5,"O, then, what graces in my love do dwell,"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,1,1,HERMIA,6,That he hath turn'd a heaven unto a hell!
A Midsummer Night's Dream,1,1,LYSANDER,1,"Helen, to you our minds we will unfold:"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,1,1,LYSANDER,2,"To-morrow night, when Phoebe doth behold"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,1,1,LYSANDER,3,"Her silver visage in the watery glass,"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,1,1,LYSANDER,4,"Decking with liquid pearl the bladed grass,"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,1,1,LYSANDER,5,"A time that lovers' flights doth still conceal,"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,1,1,LYSANDER,6,Through Athens' gates have we devised to steal.
A Midsummer Night's Dream,1,1,HERMIA,1,"And in the wood, where often you and I"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,1,1,HERMIA,2,"Upon faint primrose-beds were wont to lie,"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,1,1,HERMIA,3,"Emptying our bosoms of their counsel sweet,"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,1,1,HERMIA,4,There my Lysander and myself shall meet;
A Midsummer Night's Dream,1,1,HERMIA,5,"And thence from Athens turn away our eyes,"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,1,1,HERMIA,6,To seek new friends and stranger companies.
A Midsummer Night's Dream,1,1,HERMIA,7,"Farewell, sweet playfellow: pray thou for us;"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,1,1,HERMIA,8,And good luck grant thee thy Demetrius!
A Midsummer Night's Dream,1,1,HERMIA,9,"Keep word, Lysander: we must starve our sight"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,1,1,HERMIA,10,From lovers' food till morrow deep midnight.
A Midsummer Night's Dream,1,1,LYSANDER,1,"I will, my Hermia."
A Midsummer Night's Dream,1,1,LYSANDER,2,"Helena, adieu:"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,1,1,LYSANDER,3,"As you on him, Demetrius dote on you!"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,1,1,HELENA,1,How happy some o'er other some can be!
A Midsummer Night's Dream,1,1,HELENA,2,Through Athens I am thought as fair as she.
A Midsummer Night's Dream,1,1,HELENA,3,But what of that? Demetrius thinks not so;
A Midsummer Night's Dream,1,1,HELENA,4,He will not know what all but he do know:
A Midsummer Night's Dream,1,1,HELENA,5,"And as he errs, doting on Hermia's eyes,"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,1,1,HELENA,6,"So I, admiring of his qualities:"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,1,1,HELENA,7,"Things base and vile, folding no quantity,"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,1,1,HELENA,8,Love can transpose to form and dignity:
A Midsummer Night's Dream,1,1,HELENA,9,"Love looks not with the eyes, but with the mind;"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,1,1,HELENA,10,And therefore is wing'd Cupid painted blind:
A Midsummer Night's Dream,1,1,HELENA,11,Nor hath Love's mind of any judgement taste;
A Midsummer Night's Dream,1,1,HELENA,12,Wings and no eyes figure unheedy haste:
A Midsummer Night's Dream,1,1,HELENA,13,"And therefore is Love said to be a child,"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,1,1,HELENA,14,Because in choice he is so oft beguiled.
A Midsummer Night's Dream,1,1,HELENA,15,"As waggish boys in game themselves forswear,"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,1,1,HELENA,16,So the boy Love is perjured every where:
A Midsummer Night's Dream,1,1,HELENA,17,"For ere Demetrius look'd on Hermia's eyne,"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,1,1,HELENA,18,He hail'd down oaths that he was only mine;
A Midsummer Night's Dream,1,1,HELENA,19,"And when this hail some heat from Hermia felt,"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,1,1,HELENA,20,"So he dissolved, and showers of oaths did melt."
A Midsummer Night's Dream,1,1,HELENA,21,I will go tell him of fair Hermia's flight:
A Midsummer Night's Dream,1,1,HELENA,22,Then to the wood will he to-morrow night
A Midsummer Night's Dream,1,1,HELENA,23,Pursue her; and for this intelligence
A Midsummer Night's Dream,1,1,HELENA,24,"If I have thanks, it is a dear expense:"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,1,1,HELENA,25,"But herein mean I to enrich my pain,"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,1,1,HELENA,26,To have his sight thither and back again.
A Midsummer Night's Dream,1,2,QUINCE,1,Is all our company here?
A Midsummer Night's Dream,1,2,BOTTOM,1,"You were best to call them generally, man by man,"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,1,2,BOTTOM,2,according to the scrip.

A Midsummer Night's Dream,1,2,BOTTOM,1,"First, good Peter Quince, say what the play treats"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,1,2,BOTTOM,2,"on, then read the names of the actors, and so grow"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,1,2,BOTTOM,3,to a point.
A Midsummer Night's Dream,1,2,QUINCE,1,"Marry, our play is, The most lamentable comedy, and"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,1,2,QUINCE,2,most cruel death of Pyramus and Thisby.
A Midsummer Night's Dream,1,2,BOTTOM,1,"A very good piece of work, I assure you, and a"

A Midsummer Night's Dream,1,2,QUINCE,1,"Answer as I call you. Nick Bottom, the weaver."
A Midsummer Night's Dream,1,2,BOTTOM,1,"Ready. Name what part I am for, and proceed."
A Midsummer Night's Dream,1,2,QUINCE,1,"You, Nick Bottom, are set down for Pyramus."
A Midsummer Night's Dream,1,2,BOTTOM,1,"What is Pyramus? a lover, or a tyrant?"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,1,2,QUINCE,1,"A lover, that kills himself most gallant for love."
A Midsummer Night's Dream,1,2,BOTTOM,1,That will ask some tears in the true performing of
A Midsummer Night's Dream,1,2,BOTTOM,2,"it: if I do it, let the audience look to their"

A Midsummer Night's Dream,2,1,PUCK,3,I jest to Oberon and make him smile
A Midsummer Night's Dream,2,1,PUCK,4,"When I a fat and bean-fed horse beguile,"

A Midsummer Night's Dream,2,1,OBERON,1,"Tarry, rash wanton: am not I thy lord?"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,2,1,TITANIA,1,Then I must be thy lady: but I know

A Midsummer Night's Dream,2,1,TITANIA,3,"And in the shape of Corin sat all day,"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,2,1,TITANIA,4,Playing on pipes of corn and versing love
A Midsummer Night's Dream,2,1,TITANIA,5,"To amorous Phillida. Why art thou here,"

A Midsummer Night's Dream,2,1,OBERON,3,Knowing I know thy love to Theseus?

A Midsummer Night's Dream,2,1,OBERON,5,"From Perigenia, whom he ravished?"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,2,1,OBERON,6,"And make him with fair AEgle break his faith,"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,2,1,OBERON,7,With Ariadne and Antiopa?
A Midsummer Night's Dream,2,1,TITANIA,1,These are the forgeries of jealousy:
A Midsummer Night's Dream,2,1,TITANIA,2,"And never, since the middle summer's spring,"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,2,1,TITANIA,3,"Met we on hill, in dale, forest or mead,"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,2,1,TITANIA,4,"By paved fountain or by rushy brook,"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,2,1,TITANIA,5,"Or in the beached margent of the sea,"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,2,1,TITANIA,6,"To dance our ringlets to the whistling wind,"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,2,1,TITANIA,7,But with thy brawls thou hast disturb'd our sport.
A Midsummer Night's Dream,2,1,TITANIA,8,"Therefore the winds, piping to us in vain,"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,2,1,TITANIA,9,"As in revenge, have suck'd up from the sea"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,2,1,TITANIA,10,Contagious fogs; which falling in the land
A Midsummer Night's Dream,2,1,TITANIA,11,Have every pelting river made so proud
A Midsummer Night's Dream,2,1,TITANIA,12,That they have overborne their continents:
A Midsummer Night's Dream,2,1,TITANIA,13,"The ox hath therefore stretch'd his yoke in vain,"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,2,1,TITANIA,14,"The ploughman lost his sweat, and the green corn"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,2,1,TITANIA,15,Hath rotted ere his youth attain'd a beard;
A Midsummer Night's Dream,2,1,TITANIA,16,"The fold stands empty in the drowned field,"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,2,1,TITANIA,17,And crows are fatted with the murrion flock;
A Midsummer Night's Dream,2,1,TITANIA,18,"The nine men's morris is fill'd up with mud,"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,2,1,TITANIA,19,And the quaint mazes in the wanton green
A Midsummer Night's Dream,2,1,TITANIA,20,For lack of tread are undistinguishable:
A Midsummer Night's Dream,2,1,TITANIA,21,The human mortals want their winter here;
A Midsummer Night's Dream,2,1,TITANIA,22,No night is now with hymn or carol blest:
A Midsummer Night's Dream,2,1,TITANIA,23,"Therefore the moon, the governess of floods,"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,2,1,TITANIA,24,"Pale in her anger, washes all the air,"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,2,1,TITANIA,25,That rheumatic diseases do abound:
A Midsummer Night's Dream,2,1,TITANIA,26,And thorough this distemperature we see
A Midsummer Night's Dream,2,1,TITANIA,27,The seasons alter: hoary-headed frosts
A Midsummer Night's Dream,2,1,TITANIA,28,"Far in the fresh lap of the crimson rose,"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,2,1,TITANIA,29,And on old Hiems' thin and icy crown
A Midsummer Night's Dream,2,1,TITANIA,30,An odorous chaplet of sweet summer buds
A Midsummer Night's Dream,2,1,TITANIA,31,"Is, as in mockery, set: the spring, the summer,"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,2,1,TITANIA,32,"The childing autumn, angry winter, change"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,2,1,TITANIA,33,"Their wonted liveries, and the mazed world,"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,2,1,TITANIA,34,"By their increase, now knows not which is which:"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,2,1,TITANIA,35,And this same progeny of evils comes
A Midsummer Night's Dream,2,1,TITANIA,36,"From our debate, from our dissension;"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,2,1,TITANIA,37,We are their parents and original.
A Midsummer Night's Dream,2,1,OBERON,1,Do you amend it then; it lies in you:
A Midsummer Night's Dream,2,1,OBERON,2,Why should Titania cross her Oberon?
A Midsummer Night's Dream,2,1,OBERON,3,"I do but beg a little changeling boy,"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,2,1,OBERON,4,To be my henchman.
A Midsummer Night's Dream,2,1,TITANIA,1,Set your heart at rest:
A Midsummer Night's Dream,2,1,TITANIA,2,The fairy land buys not the child of me.
A Midsummer Night's Dream,2,1,TITANIA,3,His mother was a votaress of my order:
A Midsummer Night's Dream,2,1,TITANIA,4,"And, in the spiced Indian air, by night,"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,2,1,TITANIA,5,"Full often hath she gossip'd by my side,"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,2,1,TITANIA,6,"And sat with me on Neptune's yellow sands,"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,2,1,TITANIA,7,"Marking the embarked traders on the flood,"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,2,1,TITANIA,8,When we have laugh'd to see the sails conceive
A Midsummer Night's Dream,2,1,TITANIA,9,And grow big-bellied with the wanton wind;
A Midsummer Night's Dream,2,1,TITANIA,10,"Which she, with pretty and with swimming gait"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,2,1,TITANIA,11,"Following,--her womb then rich with my young squire,--"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,2,1,TITANIA,12,"Would imitate, and sail upon the land,"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,2,1,TITANIA,13,"To fetch me trifles, and return again,"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,2,1,TITANIA,14,"As from a voyage, rich with merchandise."
A Midsummer Night's Dream,2,1,TITANIA,15,"But she, being mortal, of that boy did die;"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,2,1,TITANIA,16,"And for her sake do I rear up her boy,"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,2,1,TITANIA,17,And for her sake I will not part with him.
A Midsummer Night's Dream,2,1,OBERON,1,How long within this wood intend you stay?
A Midsummer Night's Dream,2,1,TITANIA,1,Perchance till after Theseus' wedding-day.
A Midsummer Night's Dream,2,1,TITANIA,2,If you will patiently dance in our round
A Midsummer Night's Dream,2,1,TITANIA,3,"And see our moonlight revels, go with us;"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,2,1,TITANIA,4,"If not, shun me, and I will spare your haunts."
A Midsummer Night's Dream,2,1,OBERON,1,"Give me that boy, and I will go with thee."
A Midsummer Night's Dream,2,1,TITANIA,1,"Not for thy fairy kingdom. Fairies, away!"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,2,1,TITANIA,2,"We shall chide downright, if I longer stay."
A Midsummer Night's Dream,2,1,OBERON,1,"Well, go thy way: thou shalt not from this grove"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,2,1,OBERON,2,Till I torment thee for this injury.
A Midsummer Night's Dream,2,1,OBERON,3,"My gentle Puck, come hither. Thou rememberest"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,2,1,OBERON,4,"Since once I sat upon a promontory,"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,2,1,OBERON,5,And heard a mermaid on a dolphin's back
A Midsummer Night's Dream,2,1,OBERON,6,Uttering such dulcet and harmonious breath
A Midsummer Night's Dream,2,1,OBERON,7,That the rude sea grew civil at her song
A Midsummer Night's Dream,2,1,OBERON,8,"And certain stars shot madly from their spheres,"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,2,1,OBERON,9,To hear the sea-maid's music.
A Midsummer Night's Dream,2,1,PUCK,1,I remember.
A Midsummer Night's Dream,2,1,OBERON,1,"That very time I saw, but thou couldst not,"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,2,1,OBERON,2,"Flying between the cold moon and the earth,"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,2,1,OBERON,3,Cupid all arm'd: a certain aim he took
A Midsummer Night's Dream,2,1,OBERON,4,"At a fair vestal throned by the west,"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,2,1,OBERON,5,"And loosed his love-shaft smartly from his bow,"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,2,1,OBERON,6,As it should pierce a hundred thousand hearts;
A Midsummer Night's Dream,2,1,OBERON,7,But I might see young Cupid's fiery shaft
A Midsummer Night's Dream,2,1,OBERON,8,"Quench'd in the chaste beams of the watery moon,"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,2,1,OBERON,9,"And the imperial votaress passed on,"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,2,1,OBERON,10,"In maiden meditation, fancy-free."
A Midsummer Night's Dream,2,1,OBERON,11,Yet mark'd I where the bolt of Cupid fell:
A Midsummer Night's Dream,2,1,OBERON,12,"It fell upon a little western flower,"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,2,1,OBERON,13,"Before milk-white, now purple with love's wound,"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,2,1,OBERON,14,And maidens call it love-in-idleness.
A Midsummer Night's Dream,2,1,OBERON,15,Fetch me that flower; the herb I shew'd thee once:
A Midsummer Night's Dream,2,1,OBERON,16,The juice of it on sleeping eye-lids laid
A Midsummer Night's Dream,2,1,OBERON,17,Will make or man or woman madly dote
A Midsummer Night's Dream,2,1,OBERON,18,Upon the next live creature that it sees.
A Midsummer Night's Dream,2,1,OBERON,19,Fetch me this herb; and be thou here again
A Midsummer Night's Dream,2,1,OBERON,20,Ere the leviathan can swim a league.
A Midsummer Night's Dream,2,1,PUCK,1,I'll put a girdle round about the earth
A Midsummer Night's Dream,2,1,PUCK,2,In forty minutes.
A Midsummer Night's Dream,2,1,OBERON,1,"Having once this juice,"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,2,1,OBERON,2,"I'll watch Titania when she is asleep,"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,2,1,OBERON,3,And drop the liquor of it in her eyes.
A Midsummer Night's Dream,2,1,OBERON,4,"The next thing then she waking looks upon,"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,2,1,OBERON,5,"Be it on lion, bear, or wolf, or bull,"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,2,1,OBERON,6,"On meddling monkey, or on busy ape,"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,2,1,OBERON,7,She shall pursue it with the soul of love:
A Midsummer Night's Dream,2,1,OBERON,8,"And ere I take this charm from off her sight,"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,2,1,OBERON,9,"As I can take it with another herb,"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,2,1,OBERON,10,I'll make her render up her page to me.
A Midsummer Night's Dream,2,1,OBERON,11,But who comes here? I am invisible;
A Midsummer Night's Dream,2,1,OBERON,12,And I will overhear their conference.
A Midsummer Night's Dream,2,1,DEMETRIUS,1,"I love thee not, therefore pursue me not."
A Midsummer Night's Dream,2,1,DEMETRIUS,2,Where is Lysander and fair Hermia?
A Midsummer Night's Dream,2,1,DEMETRIUS,3,"The one I'll slay, the other slayeth me."
A Midsummer Night's Dream,2,1,DEMETRIUS,4,Thou told'st me they were stolen unto this wood;
A Midsummer Night's Dream,2,1,DEMETRIUS,5,"And here am I, and wode within this wood,"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,2,1,DEMETRIUS,6,Because I cannot meet my Hermia.
A Midsummer Night's Dream,2,1,DEMETRIUS,7,"Hence, get thee gone, and follow me no more."
A Midsummer Night's Dream,2,1,HELENA,1,"You draw me, you hard-hearted adamant;"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,2,1,HELENA,2,"But yet you draw not iron, for my heart"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,2,1,HELENA,3,"Is true as steel: leave you your power to draw,"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,2,1,HELENA,4,And I shall have no power to follow you.
A Midsummer Night's Dream,2,1,DEMETRIUS,1,Do I entice you? do I speak you fair?
A Midsummer Night's Dream,2,1,DEMETRIUS,2,"Or, rather, do I not in plainest truth"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,2,1,DEMETRIUS,3,"Tell you, I do not, nor I cannot love you?"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,2,1,HELENA,1,And even for that do I love you the more.
A Midsummer Night's Dream,2,1,HELENA,2,"I am your spaniel; and, Demetrius,"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,2,1,HELENA,3,"The more you beat me, I will fawn on you:"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,2,1,HELENA,4,"Use me but as your spaniel, spurn me, strike me,"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,2,1,HELENA,5,"Neglect me, lose me; only give me leave,"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,2,1,HELENA,6,"Unworthy as I am, to follow you."
A Midsummer Night's Dream,2,1,HELENA,7,"What worser place can I beg in your love,--"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,2,1,HELENA,8,"And yet a place of high respect with me,--"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,2,1,HELENA,9,Than to be used as you use your dog?
A Midsummer Night's Dream,2,1,DEMETRIUS,1,Tempt not too much the hatred of my spirit;
A Midsummer Night's Dream,2,1,DEMETRIUS,2,For I am sick when I do look on thee.
A Midsummer Night's Dream,2,1,HELENA,1,And I am sick when I look not on you.
A Midsummer Night's Dream,2,1,DEMETRIUS,1,"You do impeach your modesty too much,"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,2,1,DEMETRIUS,2,To leave the city and commit yourself
A Midsummer Night's Dream,2,1,DEMETRIUS,3,Into the hands of one that loves you not;
A Midsummer Night's Dream,2,1,DEMETRIUS,4,To trust the opportunity of night
A Midsummer Night's Dream,2,1,DEMETRIUS,5,And the ill counsel of a desert place
A Midsummer Night's Dream,2,1,DEMETRIUS,6,With the rich worth of your virginity.
A Midsummer Night's Dream,2,1,HELENA,1,Your virtue is my privilege: for that
A Midsummer Night's Dream,2,1,HELENA,2,"It is not night when I do see your face,"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,2,1,HELENA,3,Therefore I think I am not in the night;
A Midsummer Night's Dream,2,1,HELENA,4,"Nor doth this wood lack worlds of company,"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,2,1,HELENA,5,For you in my respect are all the world:
A Midsummer Night's Dream,2,1,HELENA,6,"Then how can it be said I am alone,"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,2,1,HELENA,7,When all the world is here to look on me?
A Midsummer Night's Dream,2,1,DEMETRIUS,1,"I'll run from thee and hide me in the brakes,"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,2,1,DEMETRIUS,2,And leave thee to the mercy of wild beasts.
A Midsummer Night's Dream,2,1,HELENA,1,The wildest hath not such a heart as you.
A Midsummer Night's Dream,2,1,HELENA,2,"Run when you will, the story shall be changed:"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,2,1,HELENA,3,"Apollo flies, and Daphne holds the chase;"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,2,1,HELENA,4,The dove pursues the griffin; the mild hind
A Midsummer Night's Dream,2,1,HELENA,5,"Makes speed to catch the tiger; bootless speed,"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,2,1,HELENA,6,When cowardice pursues and valour flies.
A Midsummer Night's Dream,2,1,DEMETRIUS,1,I will not stay thy questions; let me go:
A Midsummer Night's Dream,2,1,DEMETRIUS,2,"Or, if thou follow me, do not believe"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,2,1,DEMETRIUS,3,But I shall do thee mischief in the wood.
A Midsummer Night's Dream,2,1,HELENA,1,"Ay, in the temple, in the town, the field,"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,2,1,HELENA,2,"You do me mischief. Fie, Demetrius!"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,2,1,HELENA,3,Your wrongs do set a scandal on my sex:
A Midsummer Night's Dream,2,1,HELENA,4,"We cannot fight for love, as men may do;"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,2,1,HELENA,5,We should be wood and were not made to woo.
A Midsummer Night's Dream,2,1,HELENA,6,"I'll follow thee and make a heaven of hell,"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,2,1,HELENA,7,To die upon the hand I love so well.
A Midsummer Night's Dream,2,1,OBERON,1,"Fare thee well, nymph: ere he do leave this grove,"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,2,1,OBERON,2,Thou shalt fly him and he shall seek thy love.
A Midsummer Night's Dream,2,1,OBERON,3,"Hast thou the flower there? Welcome, wanderer."
A Midsummer Night's Dream,2,1,PUCK,1,"Ay, there it is."
A Midsummer Night's Dream,2,1,OBERON,1,"I pray thee, give it me."
A Midsummer Night's Dream,2,1,OBERON,2,"I know a bank where the wild thyme blows,"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,2,1,OBERON,3,"Where oxlips and the nodding violet grows,"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,2,1,OBERON,4,"Quite over-canopied with luscious woodbine,"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,2,1,OBERON,5,With sweet musk-roses and with eglantine:
A Midsummer Night's Dream,2,1,OBERON,6,"There sleeps Titania sometime of the night,"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,2,1,OBERON,7,Lull'd in these flowers with dances and delight;
A Midsummer Night's Dream,2,1,OBERON,8,"And there the snake throws her enamell'd skin,"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,2,1,OBERON,9,Weed wide enough to wrap a fairy in:
A Midsummer Night's Dream,2,1,OBERON,10,"And with the juice of this I'll streak her eyes,"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,2,1,OBERON,11,And make her full of hateful fantasies.
A Midsummer Night's Dream,2,1,OBERON,12,"Take thou some of it, and seek through this grove:"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,2,1,OBERON,13,A sweet Athenian lady is in love
A Midsummer Night's Dream,2,1,OBERON,14,With a disdainful youth: anoint his eyes;
A Midsummer Night's Dream,2,1,OBERON,15,But do it when the next thing he espies
A Midsummer Night's Dream,2,1,OBERON,16,May be the lady: thou shalt know the man
A Midsummer Night's Dream,2,1,OBERON,17,By the Athenian garments he hath on.
A Midsummer Night's Dream,2,1,OBERON,18,"Effect it with some care, that he may prove"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,2,1,OBERON,19,More fond on her than she upon her love:
A Midsummer Night's Dream,2,1,OBERON,20,And look thou meet me ere the first cock crow.
A Midsummer Night's Dream,2,1,PUCK,1,"Fear not, my lord, your servant shall do so."
A Midsummer Night's Dream,2,2,TITANIA,1,"Come, now a roundel and a fairy song;"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,2,2,TITANIA,2,"Then, for the third part of a minute, hence;"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,2,2,TITANIA,3,"Some to kill cankers in the musk-rose buds,"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,2,2,TITANIA,4,"Some war with rere-mice for their leathern wings,"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,2,2,TITANIA,5,"To make my small elves coats, and some keep back"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,2,2,TITANIA,6,The clamorous owl that nightly hoots and wonders
A Midsummer Night's Dream,2,2,TITANIA,7,At our quaint spirits. Sing me now asleep;
A Midsummer Night's Dream,2,2,TITANIA,8,Then to your offices and let me rest.
A Midsummer Night's Dream,2,2,TITANIA,9,"You spotted snakes with double tongue,"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,2,2,TITANIA,10,"Thorny hedgehogs, be not seen;"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,2,2,TITANIA,11,"Newts and blind-worms, do no wrong,"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,2,2,TITANIA,12,Come not near our fairy queen.
A Midsummer Night's Dream,2,2,TITANIA,13,"Philomel, with melody"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,2,2,TITANIA,14,Sing in our sweet lullaby;
A Midsummer Night's Dream,2,2,TITANIA,15,"Lulla, lulla, lullaby, lulla, lulla, lullaby:"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,2,2,TITANIA,16,"Never harm,"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,2,2,TITANIA,17,"Nor spell nor charm,"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,2,2,TITANIA,18,Come our lovely lady nigh;
A Midsummer Night's Dream,2,2,TITANIA,19,"So, good night, with lullaby."
A Midsummer Night's Dream,2,2,TITANIA,20,"Weaving spiders, come not here;"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,2,2,TITANIA,21,"Hence, you long-legg'd spinners, hence!"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,2,2,TITANIA,22,"Beetles black, approach not near;"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,2,2,TITANIA,23,"Worm nor snail, do no offence."
A Midsummer Night's Dream,2,2,TITANIA,24,"Philomel, with melody, &c."
A Midsummer Night's Dream,2,2,FAIRY,1,"Hence, away! now all is well:"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,2,2,FAIRY,2,One aloof stand sentinel.
A Midsummer Night's Dream,2,2,OBERON,1,"What thou seest when thou dost wake,"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,2,2,OBERON,2,"Do it for thy true-love take,"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,2,2,OBERON,3,Love and languish for his sake:
A Midsummer Night's Dream,2,2,OBERON,4,"Be it ounce, or cat, or bear,"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,2,2,OBERON,5,"Pard, or boar with bristled hair,"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,2,2,OBERON,6,In thy eye that shall appear
A Midsummer Night's Dream,2,2,OBERON,7,"When thou wakest, it is thy dear:"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,2,2,OBERON,8,Wake when some vile thing is near.
A Midsummer Night's Dream,2,2,LYSANDER,1,"Fair love, you faint with wandering in the wood;"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,2,2,LYSANDER,2,"And to speak troth, I have forgot our way:"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,2,2,LYSANDER,3,"We'll rest us, Hermia, if you think it good,"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,2,2,LYSANDER,4,And tarry for the comfort of the day.
A Midsummer Night's Dream,2,2,HERMIA,1,"Be it so, Lysander: find you out a bed;"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,2,2,HERMIA,2,For I upon this bank will rest my head.
A Midsummer Night's Dream,2,2,LYSANDER,1,One turf shall serve as pillow for us both;
A Midsummer Night's Dream,2,2,LYSANDER,2,"One heart, one bed, two bosoms and one troth."
A Midsummer Night's Dream,2,2,HERMIA,1,"Nay, good Lysander; for my sake, my dear,"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,2,2,HERMIA,2,"Lie further off yet, do not lie so near."
A Midsummer Night's Dream,2,2,LYSANDER,1,"O, take the sense, sweet, of my innocence!"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,2,2,LYSANDER,2,Love takes the meaning in love's conference.
A Midsummer Night's Dream,2,2,LYSANDER,3,"I mean, that my heart unto yours is knit"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,2,2,LYSANDER,4,So that but one heart we can make of it;
A Midsummer Night's Dream,2,2,LYSANDER,5,Two bosoms interchained with an oath;
A Midsummer Night's Dream,2,2,LYSANDER,6,So then two bosoms and a single troth.
A Midsummer Night's Dream,2,2,LYSANDER,7,Then by your side no bed-room me deny;
A Midsummer Night's Dream,2,2,LYSANDER,8,"For lying so, Hermia, I do not lie."
A Midsummer Night's Dream,2,2,HERMIA,1,Lysander riddles very prettily:
A Midsummer Night's Dream,2,2,HERMIA,2,"Now much beshrew my manners and my pride,"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,2,2,HERMIA,3,If Hermia meant to say Lysander lied.
A Midsummer Night's Dream,2,2,HERMIA,4,"But, gentle friend, for love and courtesy"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,2,2,HERMIA,5,"Lie further off; in human modesty,"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,2,2,HERMIA,6,Such separation as may well be said
A Midsummer Night's Dream,2,2,HERMIA,7,"Becomes a virtuous bachelor and a maid,"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,2,2,HERMIA,8,"So far be distant; and, good night, sweet friend:"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,2,2,HERMIA,9,Thy love ne'er alter till thy sweet life end!
A Midsummer Night's Dream,2,2,LYSANDER,1,"Amen, amen, to that fair prayer, say I;"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,2,2,LYSANDER,2,And then end life when I end loyalty!
A Midsummer Night's Dream,2,2,LYSANDER,3,Here is my bed: sleep give thee all his rest!
A Midsummer Night's Dream,2,2,HERMIA,1,With half that wish the wisher's eyes be press'd!
A Midsummer Night's Dream,2,2,PUCK,1,Through the forest have I gone.
A Midsummer Night's Dream,2,2,PUCK,2,"But Athenian found I none,"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,2,2,PUCK,3,On whose eyes I might approve
A Midsummer Night's Dream,2,2,PUCK,4,This flower's force in stirring love.
A Midsummer Night's Dream,2,2,PUCK,5,Night and silence.--Who is here?
A Midsummer Night's Dream,2,2,PUCK,6,Weeds of Athens he doth wear:
A Midsummer Night's Dream,2,2,PUCK,7,"This is he, my master said,"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,2,2,PUCK,8,Despised the Athenian maid;
A Midsummer Night's Dream,2,2,PUCK,9,"And here the maiden, sleeping sound,"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,2,2,PUCK,10,On the dank and dirty ground.
A Midsummer Night's Dream,2,2,PUCK,11,Pretty soul! she durst not lie
A Midsummer Night's Dream,2,2,PUCK,12,"Near this lack-love, this kill-courtesy."
A Midsummer Night's Dream,2,2,PUCK,13,"Churl, upon thy eyes I throw"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,2,2,PUCK,14,All the power this charm doth owe.
A Midsummer Night's Dream,2,2,PUCK,15,"When thou wakest, let love forbid"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,2,2,PUCK,16,Sleep his seat on thy eyelid:
A Midsummer Night's Dream,2,2,PUCK,17,So awake when I am gone;
A Midsummer Night's Dream,2,2,PUCK,18,For I must now to Oberon.
A Midsummer Night's Dream,2,2,HELENA,1,"Stay, though thou kill me, sweet Demetrius."
A Midsummer Night's Dream,2,2,DEMETRIUS,1,"I charge thee, hence, and do not haunt me thus."
A Midsummer Night's Dream,2,2,HELENA,1,"O, wilt thou darkling leave me? do not so."
A Midsummer Night's Dream,2,2,DEMETRIUS,1,"Stay, on thy peril: I alone will go."
A Midsummer Night's Dream,2,2,HELENA,1,"O, I am out of breath in this fond chase!"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,2,2,HELENA,2,"The more my prayer, the lesser is my grace."
A Midsummer Night's Dream,2,2,HELENA,3,"Happy is Hermia, wheresoe'er she lies;"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,2,2,HELENA,4,For she hath blessed and attractive eyes.
A Midsummer Night's Dream,2,2,HELENA,5,How came her eyes so bright? Not with salt tears:
A Midsummer Night's Dream,2,2,HELENA,6,"If so, my eyes are oftener wash'd than hers."
A Midsummer Night's Dream,2,2,HELENA,7,"No, no, I am as ugly as a bear;"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,2,2,HELENA,8,For beasts that meet me run away for fear:
A Midsummer Night's Dream,2,2,HELENA,9,Therefore no marvel though Demetrius
A Midsummer Night's Dream,2,2,HELENA,10,"Do, as a monster fly my presence thus."
A Midsummer Night's Dream,2,2,HELENA,11,What wicked and dissembling glass of mine
A Midsummer Night's Dream,2,2,HELENA,12,Made me compare with Hermia's sphery eyne?
A Midsummer Night's Dream,2,2,HELENA,13,But who is here? Lysander! on the ground!
A Midsummer Night's Dream,2,2,HELENA,14,"Dead? or asleep? I see no blood, no wound."
A Midsummer Night's Dream,2,2,HELENA,15,"Lysander if you live, good sir, awake."
A Midsummer Night's Dream,2,2,LYSANDER,1,"Transparent Helena! Nature shows art,"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,2,2,LYSANDER,2,That through thy bosom makes me see thy heart.
A Midsummer Night's Dream,2,2,LYSANDER,3,"Where is Demetrius? O, how fit a word"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,2,2,LYSANDER,4,Is that vile name to perish on my sword!
A Midsummer Night's Dream,2,2,HELENA,1,"Do not say so, Lysander; say not so"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,2,2,HELENA,2,"What though he love your Hermia? Lord, what though?"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,2,2,HELENA,3,Yet Hermia still loves you: then be content.
A Midsummer Night's Dream,2,2,LYSANDER,1,Content with Hermia! No; I do repent
A Midsummer Night's Dream,2,2,LYSANDER,2,The tedious minutes I with her have spent.
A Midsummer Night's Dream,2,2,LYSANDER,3,Not Hermia but Helena I love:
A Midsummer Night's Dream,2,2,LYSANDER,4,Who will not change a raven for a dove?
A Midsummer Night's Dream,2,2,LYSANDER,5,The will of man is by his reason sway'd;
A Midsummer Night's Dream,2,2,LYSANDER,6,And reason says you are the worthier maid.
A Midsummer Night's Dream,2,2,LYSANDER,7,Things growing are not ripe until their season
A Midsummer Night's Dream,2,2,LYSANDER,8,"So I, being young, till now ripe not to reason;"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,2,2,LYSANDER,9,"And touching now the point of human skill,"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,2,2,LYSANDER,10,Reason becomes the marshal to my will
A Midsummer Night's Dream,2,2,LYSANDER,11,"And leads me to your eyes, where I o'erlook"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,2,2,LYSANDER,12,Love's stories written in love's richest book.
A Midsummer Night's Dream,2,2,HELENA,1,Wherefore was I to this keen mockery born?
A Midsummer Night's Dream,2,2,HELENA,2,When at your hands did I deserve this scorn?
A Midsummer Night's Dream,2,2,HELENA,3,"Is't not enough, is't not enough, young man,"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,2,2,HELENA,4,"That I did never, no, nor never can,"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,2,2,HELENA,5,"Deserve a sweet look from Demetrius' eye,"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,2,2,HELENA,6,But you must flout my insufficiency?
A Midsummer Night's Dream,2,2,HELENA,7,"Good troth, you do me wrong, good sooth, you do,"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,2,2,HELENA,8,In such disdainful manner me to woo.
A Midsummer Night's Dream,2,2,HELENA,9,But fare you well: perforce I must confess
A Midsummer Night's Dream,2,2,HELENA,10,I thought you lord of more true gentleness.
A Midsummer Night's Dream,2,2,HELENA,11,"O, that a lady, of one man refused."
A Midsummer Night's Dream,2,2,HELENA,12,Should of another therefore be abused!
A Midsummer Night's Dream,2,2,LYSANDER,1,"She sees not Hermia. Hermia, sleep thou there:"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,2,2,LYSANDER,2,And never mayst thou come Lysander near!
A Midsummer Night's Dream,2,2,LYSANDER,3,For as a surfeit of the sweetest things
A Midsummer Night's Dream,2,2,LYSANDER,4,"The deepest loathing to the stomach brings,"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,2,2,LYSANDER,5,Or as tie heresies that men do leave
A Midsummer Night's Dream,2,2,LYSANDER,6,"Are hated most of those they did deceive,"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,2,2,LYSANDER,7,"So thou, my surfeit and my heresy,"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,2,2,LYSANDER,8,"Of all be hated, but the most of me!"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,2,2,LYSANDER,9,"And, all my powers, address your love and might"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,2,2,LYSANDER,10,To honour Helen and to be her knight!
A Midsummer Night's Dream,2,2,HERMIA,1,To pluck this crawling serpent from my breast!
A Midsummer Night's Dream,2,2,HERMIA,2,"Ay me, for pity! what a dream was here!"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,2,2,HERMIA,3,"Lysander, look how I do quake with fear:"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,2,2,HERMIA,4,"Methought a serpent eat my heart away,"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,2,2,HERMIA,5,And you sat smiling at his cruel pray.
A Midsummer Night's Dream,2,2,HERMIA,6,"Lysander! what, removed? Lysander! lord!"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,2,2,HERMIA,7,"What, out of hearing? gone? no sound, no word?"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,2,2,HERMIA,8,"Alack, where are you speak, an if you hear;"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,2,2,HERMIA,9,"Speak, of all loves! I swoon almost with fear."
A Midsummer Night's Dream,2,2,HERMIA,10,No? then I well perceive you all not nigh
A Midsummer Night's Dream,2,2,HERMIA,11,Either death or you I'll find immediately.
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,1,BOTTOM,1,Are we all met?
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,1,QUINCE,1,"Pat, pat; and here's a marvellous convenient place"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,1,QUINCE,2,for our rehearsal. This green plot shall be our
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,1,QUINCE,3,"stage, this hawthorn-brake our tiring-house; and we"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,1,QUINCE,4,will do it in action as we will do it before the duke.
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,1,BOTTOM,1,"Peter Quince,--"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,1,QUINCE,1,"What sayest thou, bully Bottom?"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,1,BOTTOM,1,There are things in this comedy of Pyramus and
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,1,BOTTOM,2,"Thisby that will never please. First, Pyramus must"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,1,BOTTOM,3,draw a sword to kill himself; which the ladies
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,1,BOTTOM,4,cannot abide. How answer you that?
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,1,SNOUT,1,"By'r lakin, a parlous fear."
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,1,STARVELING,1,"I believe we must leave the killing out, when all is done."
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,1,BOTTOM,1,Not a whit: I have a device to make all well.
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,1,BOTTOM,2,Write me a prologue; and let the prologue seem to
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,1,BOTTOM,3,"say, we will do no harm with our swords, and that"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,1,BOTTOM,4,"Pyramus is not killed indeed; and, for the more"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,1,BOTTOM,5,"better assurance, tell them that I, Pyramus, am not"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,1,BOTTOM,6,"Pyramus, but Bottom the weaver: this will put them"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,1,BOTTOM,7,out of fear.
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,1,QUINCE,1,"Well, we will have such a prologue; and it shall be"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,1,QUINCE,2,written in eight and six.
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,1,BOTTOM,1,"No, make it two more; let it be written in eight and eight."
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,1,SNOUT,1,Will not the ladies be afeard of the lion?
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,1,STARVELING,1,"I fear it, I promise you."
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,1,BOTTOM,1,"Masters, you ought to consider with yourselves: to"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,1,BOTTOM,2,"bring in--God shield us!--a lion among ladies, is a"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,1,BOTTOM,3,most dreadful thing; for there is not a more fearful
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,1,BOTTOM,4,wild-fowl than your lion living; and we ought to
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,1,BOTTOM,5,look to 't.
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,1,SNOUT,1,Therefore another prologue must tell he is not a lion.
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,1,BOTTOM,1,"Nay, you must name his name, and half his face must"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,1,BOTTOM,2,be seen through the lion's neck: and he himself
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,1,BOTTOM,3,"must speak through, saying thus, or to the same"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,1,BOTTOM,4,"defect,--'Ladies,'--or 'Fair-ladies--I would wish"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,1,BOTTOM,5,"You,'--or 'I would request you,'--or 'I would"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,1,BOTTOM,6,"entreat you,--not to fear, not to tremble: my life"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,1,BOTTOM,7,"for yours. If you think I come hither as a lion, it"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,1,BOTTOM,8,were pity of my life: no I am no such thing; I am a
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,1,BOTTOM,9,man as other men are;' and there indeed let him name
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,1,BOTTOM,10,"his name, and tell them plainly he is Snug the joiner."
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,1,QUINCE,1,Well it shall be so. But there is two hard things;
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,1,QUINCE,2,"that is, to bring the moonlight into a chamber; for,"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,1,QUINCE,3,"you know, Pyramus and Thisby meet by moonlight."
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,1,SNOUT,1,Doth the moon shine that night we play our play?
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,1,BOTTOM,1,"A calendar, a calendar! look in the almanac; find"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,1,BOTTOM,2,"out moonshine, find out moonshine."
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,1,QUINCE,1,"Yes, it doth shine that night."
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,1,BOTTOM,1,"Why, then may you leave a casement of the great"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,1,BOTTOM,2,"chamber window, where we play, open, and the moon"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,1,BOTTOM,3,may shine in at the casement.
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,1,QUINCE,1,Ay; or else one must come in with a bush of thorns
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,1,QUINCE,2,"and a lanthorn, and say he comes to disfigure, or to"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,1,QUINCE,3,"present, the person of Moonshine. Then, there is"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,1,QUINCE,4,another thing: we must have a wall in the great
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,1,QUINCE,5,"chamber; for Pyramus and Thisby says the story, did"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,1,QUINCE,6,talk through the chink of a wall.
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,1,SNOUT,1,"You can never bring in a wall. What say you, Bottom?"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,1,BOTTOM,1,Some man or other must present Wall: and let him
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,1,BOTTOM,2,"have some plaster, or some loam, or some rough-cast"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,1,BOTTOM,3,"about him, to signify wall; and let him hold his"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,1,BOTTOM,4,"fingers thus, and through that cranny shall Pyramus"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,1,BOTTOM,5,and Thisby whisper.
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,1,QUINCE,1,"If that may be, then all is well. Come, sit down,"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,1,QUINCE,2,"every mother's son, and rehearse your parts."
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,1,QUINCE,3,"Pyramus, you begin: when you have spoken your"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,1,QUINCE,4,"speech, enter into that brake: and so every one"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,1,QUINCE,5,according to his cue.
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,1,PUCK,1,"What hempen home-spuns have we swaggering here,"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,1,PUCK,2,So near the cradle of the fairy queen?
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,1,PUCK,3,"What, a play toward! I'll be an auditor;"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,1,PUCK,4,"An actor too, perhaps, if I see cause."
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,1,QUINCE,1,"Speak, Pyramus. Thisby, stand forth."
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,1,BOTTOM,1,"Thisby, the flowers of odious savours sweet,--"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,1,QUINCE,1,"Odours, odours."
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,1,BOTTOM,1,--odours savours sweet:
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,1,BOTTOM,2,"So hath thy breath, my dearest Thisby dear."
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,1,BOTTOM,3,"But hark, a voice! stay thou but here awhile,"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,1,BOTTOM,4,And by and by I will to thee appear.
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,1,PUCK,1,A stranger Pyramus than e'er played here.
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,1,FLUTE,1,Must I speak now?
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,1,QUINCE,1,"Ay, marry, must you; for you must understand he goes"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,1,QUINCE,2,"but to see a noise that he heard, and is to come again."
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,1,FLUTE,1,"Most radiant Pyramus, most lily-white of hue,"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,1,FLUTE,2,"Of colour like the red rose on triumphant brier,"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,1,FLUTE,3,"Most brisky juvenal and eke most lovely Jew,"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,1,FLUTE,4,"As true as truest horse that yet would never tire,"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,1,FLUTE,5,"I'll meet thee, Pyramus, at Ninny's tomb."
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,1,QUINCE,1,"'Ninus' tomb,' man: why, you must not speak that"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,1,QUINCE,2,yet; that you answer to Pyramus: you speak all your
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,1,QUINCE,3,"part at once, cues and all Pyramus enter: your cue"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,1,QUINCE,4,"is past; it is, 'never tire.'"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,1,FLUTE,1,"O,--As true as truest horse, that yet would"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,1,FLUTE,2,never tire.
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,1,BOTTOM,1,"If I were fair, Thisby, I were only thine."
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,1,QUINCE,1,"O monstrous! O strange! we are haunted. Pray,"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,1,QUINCE,2,"masters! fly, masters! Help!"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,1,PUCK,1,"I'll follow you, I'll lead you about a round,"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,1,PUCK,2,"Through bog, through bush, through brake, through brier:"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,1,PUCK,3,"Sometime a horse I'll be, sometime a hound,"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,1,PUCK,4,"A hog, a headless bear, sometime a fire;"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,1,PUCK,5,"And neigh, and bark, and grunt, and roar, and burn,"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,1,PUCK,6,"Like horse, hound, hog, bear, fire, at every turn."
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,1,BOTTOM,1,Why do they run away? this is a knavery of them to
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,1,BOTTOM,2,make me afeard.
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,1,SNOUT,1,"O Bottom, thou art changed! what do I see on thee?"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,1,BOTTOM,1,"What do you see? you see an asshead of your own, do"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,1,BOTTOM,2,you?
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,1,QUINCE,1,"Bless thee, Bottom! bless thee! thou art"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,1,QUINCE,2,translated.
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,1,BOTTOM,1,I see their knavery: this is to make an ass of me;
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,1,BOTTOM,2,"to fright me, if they could. But I will not stir"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,1,BOTTOM,3,"from this place, do what they can: I will walk up"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,1,BOTTOM,4,"and down here, and I will sing, that they shall hear"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,1,BOTTOM,5,I am not afraid.
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,1,BOTTOM,6,"The ousel cock so black of hue,"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,1,BOTTOM,7,"With orange-tawny bill,"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,1,BOTTOM,8,"The throstle with his note so true,"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,1,BOTTOM,9,"The wren with little quill,--"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,1,BOTTOM,1,"The finch, the sparrow and the lark,"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,1,BOTTOM,2,"The plain-song cuckoo gray,"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,1,BOTTOM,3,"Whose note full many a man doth mark,"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,1,BOTTOM,4,And dares not answer nay;--
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,1,BOTTOM,5,"for, indeed, who would set his wit to so foolish"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,1,BOTTOM,6,"a bird? who would give a bird the lie, though he cry"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,1,BOTTOM,7,'cuckoo' never so?
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,1,TITANIA,1,"I pray thee, gentle mortal, sing again:"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,1,TITANIA,2,Mine ear is much enamour'd of thy note;
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,1,TITANIA,3,So is mine eye enthralled to thy shape;
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,1,TITANIA,4,And thy fair virtue's force perforce doth move me
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,1,TITANIA,5,"On the first view to say, to swear, I love thee."
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,1,BOTTOM,1,"Methinks, mistress, you should have little reason"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,1,BOTTOM,2,"for that: and yet, to say the truth, reason and"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,1,BOTTOM,3,love keep little company together now-a-days; the
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,1,BOTTOM,4,more the pity that some honest neighbours will not
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,1,BOTTOM,5,"make them friends. Nay, I can gleek upon occasion."
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,1,TITANIA,1,Thou art as wise as thou art beautiful.
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,1,BOTTOM,1,"Not so, neither: but if I had wit enough to get out"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,1,BOTTOM,2,"of this wood, I have enough to serve mine own turn."
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,1,TITANIA,1,Out of this wood do not desire to go:
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,1,TITANIA,2,"Thou shalt remain here, whether thou wilt or no."
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,1,TITANIA,3,I am a spirit of no common rate;
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,1,TITANIA,4,The summer still doth tend upon my state;
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,1,TITANIA,5,"And I do love thee: therefore, go with me;"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,1,TITANIA,6,"I'll give thee fairies to attend on thee,"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,1,TITANIA,7,"And they shall fetch thee jewels from the deep,"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,1,TITANIA,8,And sing while thou on pressed flowers dost sleep;
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,1,TITANIA,9,And I will purge thy mortal grossness so
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,1,TITANIA,10,That thou shalt like an airy spirit go.
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,1,TITANIA,11,Peaseblossom! Cobweb! Moth! and Mustardseed!
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,1,PEASEBLOSSOM,1,Ready.
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,1,COBWEB,1,And I.
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,1,MOTH,1,And I.
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,1,MUSTARDSEED,1,And I.
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,1,ALL,1,Where shall we go?
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,1,TITANIA,1,Be kind and courteous to this gentleman;
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,1,TITANIA,2,Hop in his walks and gambol in his eyes;
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,1,TITANIA,3,"Feed him with apricocks and dewberries,"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,1,TITANIA,4,"With purple grapes, green figs, and mulberries;"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,1,TITANIA,5,"The honey-bags steal from the humble-bees,"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,1,TITANIA,6,And for night-tapers crop their waxen thighs
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,1,TITANIA,7,"And light them at the fiery glow-worm's eyes,"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,1,TITANIA,8,To have my love to bed and to arise;
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,1,TITANIA,9,And pluck the wings from Painted butterflies
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,1,TITANIA,10,To fan the moonbeams from his sleeping eyes:
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,1,TITANIA,11,"Nod to him, elves, and do him courtesies."
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,1,PEASEBLOSSOM,1,"Hail, mortal!"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,1,COBWEB,1,Hail!
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,1,MOTH,1,Hail!
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,1,MUSTARDSEED,1,Hail!
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,1,BOTTOM,1,"I cry your worship's mercy, heartily: I beseech your"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,1,BOTTOM,2,worship's name.
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,1,COBWEB,1,Cobweb.
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,1,BOTTOM,1,"I shall desire you of more acquaintance, good Master"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,1,BOTTOM,2,"Cobweb: if I cut my finger, I shall make bold with"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,1,BOTTOM,3,"you. Your name, honest gentleman?"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,1,PEASEBLOSSOM,1,Peaseblossom.
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,1,BOTTOM,1,"I pray you, commend me to Mistress Squash, your"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,1,BOTTOM,2,"mother, and to Master Peascod, your father. Good"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,1,BOTTOM,3,"Master Peaseblossom, I shall desire you of more"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,1,BOTTOM,4,"acquaintance too. Your name, I beseech you, sir?"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,1,MUSTARDSEED,1,Mustardseed.
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,1,BOTTOM,1,"Good Master Mustardseed, I know your patience well:"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,1,BOTTOM,2,"that same cowardly, giant-like ox-beef hath"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,1,BOTTOM,3,devoured many a gentleman of your house: I promise
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,1,BOTTOM,4,you your kindred had made my eyes water ere now. I
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,1,BOTTOM,5,"desire your more acquaintance, good Master"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,1,BOTTOM,6,Mustardseed.
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,1,TITANIA,1,"Come, wait upon him; lead him to my bower."
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,1,TITANIA,2,The moon methinks looks with a watery eye;
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,1,TITANIA,3,"And when she weeps, weeps every little flower,"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,1,TITANIA,4,Lamenting some enforced chastity.
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,1,TITANIA,5,Tie up my love's tongue bring him silently.
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,2,OBERON,1,I wonder if Titania be awaked;
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,2,OBERON,2,"Then, what it was that next came in her eye,"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,2,OBERON,3,Which she must dote on in extremity.
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,2,OBERON,4,Here comes my messenger.
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,2,OBERON,5,"How now, mad spirit!"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,2,OBERON,6,What night-rule now about this haunted grove?
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,2,PUCK,1,My mistress with a monster is in love.
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,2,PUCK,2,"Near to her close and consecrated bower,"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,2,PUCK,3,"While she was in her dull and sleeping hour,"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,2,PUCK,4,"A crew of patches, rude mechanicals,"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,2,PUCK,5,"That work for bread upon Athenian stalls,"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,2,PUCK,6,Were met together to rehearse a play
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,2,PUCK,7,Intended for great Theseus' nuptial-day.
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,2,PUCK,8,"The shallowest thick-skin of that barren sort,"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,2,PUCK,9,"Who Pyramus presented, in their sport"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,2,PUCK,10,Forsook his scene and enter'd in a brake
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,2,PUCK,11,"When I did him at this advantage take,"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,2,PUCK,12,An ass's nole I fixed on his head:
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,2,PUCK,13,"Anon his Thisbe must be answered,"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,2,PUCK,14,"And forth my mimic comes. When they him spy,"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,2,PUCK,15,"As wild geese that the creeping fowler eye,"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,2,PUCK,16,"Or russet-pated choughs, many in sort,"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,2,PUCK,17,"Rising and cawing at the gun's report,"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,2,PUCK,18,"Sever themselves and madly sweep the sky,"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,2,PUCK,19,"So, at his sight, away his fellows fly;"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,2,PUCK,20,"And, at our stamp, here o'er and o'er one falls;"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,2,PUCK,21,He murder cries and help from Athens calls.
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,2,PUCK,22,"Their sense thus weak, lost with their fears"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,2,PUCK,23,"thus strong,"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,2,PUCK,24,Made senseless things begin to do them wrong;
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,2,PUCK,25,For briers and thorns at their apparel snatch;
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,2,PUCK,26,"Some sleeves, some hats, from yielders all"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,2,PUCK,27,things catch.
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,2,PUCK,28,"I led them on in this distracted fear,"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,2,PUCK,29,And left sweet Pyramus translated there:
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,2,PUCK,30,"When in that moment, so it came to pass,"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,2,PUCK,31,Titania waked and straightway loved an ass.
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,2,OBERON,1,This falls out better than I could devise.
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,2,OBERON,2,But hast thou yet latch'd the Athenian's eyes
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,2,OBERON,3,"With the love-juice, as I did bid thee do?"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,2,PUCK,1,"I took him sleeping,--that is finish'd too,--"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,2,PUCK,2,And the Athenian woman by his side:
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,2,PUCK,3,"That, when he waked, of force she must be eyed."
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,2,OBERON,1,Stand close: this is the same Athenian.
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,2,PUCK,1,"This is the woman, but not this the man."
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,2,DEMETRIUS,1,"O, why rebuke you him that loves you so?"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,2,DEMETRIUS,2,Lay breath so bitter on your bitter foe.
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,2,HERMIA,1,"Now I but chide; but I should use thee worse,"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,2,HERMIA,2,"For thou, I fear, hast given me cause to curse,"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,2,HERMIA,3,"If thou hast slain Lysander in his sleep,"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,2,HERMIA,4,"Being o'er shoes in blood, plunge in the deep,"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,2,HERMIA,5,And kill me too.
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,2,HERMIA,6,The sun was not so true unto the day
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,2,HERMIA,7,As he to me: would he have stolen away
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,2,HERMIA,8,From sleeping Hermia? I'll believe as soon
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,2,HERMIA,9,This whole earth may be bored and that the moon
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,2,HERMIA,10,May through the centre creep and so displease
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,2,HERMIA,11,Her brother's noontide with Antipodes.
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,2,HERMIA,12,It cannot be but thou hast murder'd him;
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,2,HERMIA,13,"So should a murderer look, so dead, so grim."
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,2,DEMETRIUS,1,"So should the murder'd look, and so should I,"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,2,DEMETRIUS,2,Pierced through the heart with your stern cruelty:
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,2,DEMETRIUS,3,"Yet you, the murderer, look as bright, as clear,"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,2,DEMETRIUS,4,As yonder Venus in her glimmering sphere.
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,2,HERMIA,1,What's this to my Lysander? where is he?
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,2,HERMIA,2,"Ah, good Demetrius, wilt thou give him me?"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,2,DEMETRIUS,1,I had rather give his carcass to my hounds.
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,2,HERMIA,1,"Out, dog! out, cur! thou drivest me past the bounds"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,2,HERMIA,2,"Of maiden's patience. Hast thou slain him, then?"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,2,HERMIA,3,Henceforth be never number'd among men!
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,2,HERMIA,4,"O, once tell true, tell true, even for my sake!"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,2,HERMIA,5,"Durst thou have look'd upon him being awake,"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,2,HERMIA,6,And hast thou kill'd him sleeping? O brave touch!
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,2,HERMIA,7,"Could not a worm, an adder, do so much?"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,2,HERMIA,8,An adder did it; for with doubler tongue
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,2,HERMIA,9,"Than thine, thou serpent, never adder stung."
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,2,DEMETRIUS,1,You spend your passion on a misprised mood:
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,2,DEMETRIUS,2,I am not guilty of Lysander's blood;
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,2,DEMETRIUS,3,"Nor is he dead, for aught that I can tell."
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,2,HERMIA,1,"I pray thee, tell me then that he is well."
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,2,DEMETRIUS,1,"An if I could, what should I get therefore?"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,2,HERMIA,1,A privilege never to see me more.
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,2,HERMIA,2,And from thy hated presence part I so:
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,2,HERMIA,3,"See me no more, whether he be dead or no."
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,2,DEMETRIUS,1,There is no following her in this fierce vein:
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,2,DEMETRIUS,2,Here therefore for a while I will remain.
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,2,DEMETRIUS,3,So sorrow's heaviness doth heavier grow
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,2,DEMETRIUS,4,For debt that bankrupt sleep doth sorrow owe:
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,2,DEMETRIUS,5,"Which now in some slight measure it will pay,"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,2,DEMETRIUS,6,If for his tender here I make some stay.
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,2,OBERON,1,What hast thou done? thou hast mistaken quite
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,2,OBERON,2,And laid the love-juice on some true-love's sight:
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,2,OBERON,3,Of thy misprision must perforce ensue
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,2,OBERON,4,Some true love turn'd and not a false turn'd true.
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,2,PUCK,1,"Then fate o'er-rules, that, one man holding troth,"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,2,PUCK,2,"A million fail, confounding oath on oath."
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,2,OBERON,1,"About the wood go swifter than the wind,"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,2,OBERON,2,And Helena of Athens look thou find:
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,2,OBERON,3,"All fancy-sick she is and pale of cheer,"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,2,OBERON,4,"With sighs of love, that costs the fresh blood dear:"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,2,OBERON,5,By some illusion see thou bring her here:
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,2,OBERON,6,I'll charm his eyes against she do appear.
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,2,PUCK,1,"I go, I go; look how I go,"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,2,PUCK,2,Swifter than arrow from the Tartar's bow.
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,2,OBERON,1,"Flower of this purple dye,"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,2,OBERON,2,"Hit with Cupid's archery,"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,2,OBERON,3,Sink in apple of his eye.
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,2,OBERON,4,"When his love he doth espy,"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,2,OBERON,5,Let her shine as gloriously
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,2,OBERON,6,As the Venus of the sky.
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,2,OBERON,7,"When thou wakest, if she be by,"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,2,OBERON,8,Beg of her for remedy.
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,2,PUCK,1,"Captain of our fairy band,"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,2,PUCK,2,Helena is here at hand;
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,2,PUCK,3,"And the youth, mistook by me,"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,2,PUCK,4,Pleading for a lover's fee.
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,2,PUCK,5,Shall we their fond pageant see?
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,2,PUCK,6,"Lord, what fools these mortals be!"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,2,OBERON,1,Stand aside: the noise they make
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,2,OBERON,2,Will cause Demetrius to awake.
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,2,PUCK,1,Then will two at once woo one;
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,2,PUCK,2,That must needs be sport alone;
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,2,PUCK,3,And those things do best please me
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,2,PUCK,4,That befal preposterously.
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,2,LYSANDER,1,Why should you think that I should woo in scorn?
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,2,LYSANDER,2,Scorn and derision never come in tears:
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,2,LYSANDER,3,"Look, when I vow, I weep; and vows so born,"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,2,LYSANDER,4,In their nativity all truth appears.
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,2,LYSANDER,5,"How can these things in me seem scorn to you,"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,2,LYSANDER,6,"Bearing the badge of faith, to prove them true?"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,2,HELENA,1,You do advance your cunning more and more.
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,2,HELENA,2,"When truth kills truth, O devilish-holy fray!"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,2,HELENA,3,These vows are Hermia's: will you give her o'er?
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,2,HELENA,4,"Weigh oath with oath, and you will nothing weigh:"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,2,HELENA,5,"Your vows to her and me, put in two scales,"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,2,HELENA,6,"Will even weigh, and both as light as tales."
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,2,LYSANDER,1,I had no judgment when to her I swore.
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,2,HELENA,1,"Nor none, in my mind, now you give her o'er."
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,2,LYSANDER,1,"Demetrius loves her, and he loves not you."
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,2,DEMETRIUS,1,"To what, my love, shall I compare thine eyne?"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,2,DEMETRIUS,2,"Crystal is muddy. O, how ripe in show"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,2,DEMETRIUS,3,"Thy lips, those kissing cherries, tempting grow!"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,2,DEMETRIUS,4,"That pure congealed white, high Taurus snow,"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,2,DEMETRIUS,5,"Fann'd with the eastern wind, turns to a crow"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,2,DEMETRIUS,6,"When thou hold'st up thy hand: O, let me kiss"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,2,DEMETRIUS,7,"This princess of pure white, this seal of bliss!"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,2,HELENA,1,O spite! O hell! I see you all are bent
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,2,HELENA,2,To set against me for your merriment:
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,2,HELENA,3,"If you we re civil and knew courtesy,"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,2,HELENA,4,You would not do me thus much injury.
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,2,HELENA,5,"Can you not hate me, as I know you do,"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,2,HELENA,6,But you must join in souls to mock me too?
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,2,HELENA,7,"If you were men, as men you are in show,"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,2,HELENA,8,You would not use a gentle lady so;
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,2,HELENA,9,"To vow, and swear, and superpraise my parts,"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,2,HELENA,10,When I am sure you hate me with your hearts.
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,2,HELENA,11,"You both are rivals, and love Hermia;"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,2,HELENA,12,"And now both rivals, to mock Helena:"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,2,HELENA,13,"A trim exploit, a manly enterprise,"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,2,HELENA,14,To conjure tears up in a poor maid's eyes
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,2,HELENA,15,With your derision! none of noble sort
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,2,HELENA,16,"Would so offend a virgin, and extort"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,2,HELENA,17,"A poor soul's patience, all to make you sport."
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,2,LYSANDER,1,"You are unkind, Demetrius; be not so;"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,2,LYSANDER,2,For you love Hermia; this you know I know:
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,2,LYSANDER,3,"And here, with all good will, with all my heart,"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,2,LYSANDER,4,In Hermia's love I yield you up my part;
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,2,LYSANDER,5,"And yours of Helena to me bequeath,"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,2,LYSANDER,6,Whom I do love and will do till my death.
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,2,HELENA,1,Never did mockers waste more idle breath.
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,2,DEMETRIUS,1,"Lysander, keep thy Hermia; I will none:"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,2,DEMETRIUS,2,"If e'er I loved her, all that love is gone."
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,2,DEMETRIUS,3,"My heart to her but as guest-wise sojourn'd,"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,2,DEMETRIUS,4,"And now to Helen is it home return'd,"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,2,DEMETRIUS,5,There to remain.
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,2,LYSANDER,1,"Helen, it is not so."
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,2,DEMETRIUS,1,"Disparage not the faith thou dost not know,"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,2,DEMETRIUS,2,"Lest, to thy peril, thou aby it dear."
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,2,DEMETRIUS,3,"Look, where thy love comes; yonder is thy dear."
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,2,HERMIA,1,"Dark night, that from the eye his function takes,"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,2,HERMIA,2,The ear more quick of apprehension makes;
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,2,HERMIA,3,"Wherein it doth impair the seeing sense,"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,2,HERMIA,4,It pays the hearing double recompense.
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,2,HERMIA,5,"Thou art not by mine eye, Lysander, found;"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,2,HERMIA,6,"Mine ear, I thank it, brought me to thy sound"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,2,HERMIA,7,But why unkindly didst thou leave me so?
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,2,LYSANDER,1,"Why should he stay, whom love doth press to go?"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,2,HERMIA,1,What love could press Lysander from my side?
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,2,LYSANDER,1,"Lysander's love, that would not let him bide,"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,2,LYSANDER,2,"Fair Helena, who more engilds the night"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,2,LYSANDER,3,Than all you fiery oes and eyes of light.
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,2,LYSANDER,4,"Why seek'st thou me? could not this make thee know,"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,2,LYSANDER,5,The hate I bear thee made me leave thee so?
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,2,HERMIA,1,You speak not as you think: it cannot be.
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,2,HELENA,1,"Lo, she is one of this confederacy!"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,2,HELENA,2,Now I perceive they have conjoin'd all three
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,2,HELENA,3,"To fashion this false sport, in spite of me."
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,2,HELENA,4,Injurious Hermia! most ungrateful maid!
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,2,HELENA,5,"Have you conspired, have you with these contrived"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,2,HELENA,6,To bait me with this foul derision?
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,2,HELENA,7,"Is all the counsel that we two have shared,"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,2,HELENA,8,"The sisters' vows, the hours that we have spent,"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,2,HELENA,9,When we have chid the hasty-footed time
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,2,HELENA,10,"For parting us,--O, is it all forgot?"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,2,HELENA,11,"All school-days' friendship, childhood innocence?"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,2,HELENA,12,"We, Hermia, like two artificial gods,"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,2,HELENA,13,"Have with our needles created both one flower,"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,2,HELENA,14,"Both on one sampler, sitting on one cushion,"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,2,HELENA,15,"Both warbling of one song, both in one key,"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,2,HELENA,16,"As if our hands, our sides, voices and minds,"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,2,HELENA,17,"Had been incorporate. So we grow together,"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,2,HELENA,18,"Like to a double cherry, seeming parted,"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,2,HELENA,19,But yet an union in partition;
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,2,HELENA,20,Two lovely berries moulded on one stem;
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,2,HELENA,21,"So, with two seeming bodies, but one heart;"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,2,HELENA,22,"Two of the first, like coats in heraldry,"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,2,HELENA,23,Due but to one and crowned with one crest.
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,2,HELENA,24,"And will you rent our ancient love asunder,"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,2,HELENA,25,To join with men in scorning your poor friend?
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,2,HELENA,26,"It is not friendly, 'tis not maidenly:"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,2,HELENA,27,"Our sex, as well as I, may chide you for it,"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,2,HELENA,28,Though I alone do feel the injury.
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,2,HERMIA,1,I am amazed at your passionate words.
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,2,HERMIA,2,I scorn you not: it seems that you scorn me.
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,2,HELENA,1,"Have you not set Lysander, as in scorn,"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,2,HELENA,2,To follow me and praise my eyes and face?
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,2,HELENA,3,"And made your other love, Demetrius,"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,2,HELENA,4,"Who even but now did spurn me with his foot,"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,2,HELENA,5,"To call me goddess, nymph, divine and rare,"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,2,HELENA,6,"Precious, celestial? Wherefore speaks he this"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,2,HELENA,7,To her he hates? and wherefore doth Lysander
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,2,HELENA,8,"Deny your love, so rich within his soul,"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,2,HELENA,9,"And tender me, forsooth, affection,"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,2,HELENA,10,"But by your setting on, by your consent?"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,2,HELENA,11,"What thought I be not so in grace as you,"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,2,HELENA,12,"So hung upon with love, so fortunate,"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,2,HELENA,13,"But miserable most, to love unloved?"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,2,HELENA,14,This you should pity rather than despise.
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,2,HERNIA,1,I understand not what you mean by this.
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,2,HELENA,1,"Ay, do, persever, counterfeit sad looks,"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,2,HELENA,2,Make mouths upon me when I turn my back;
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,2,HELENA,3,Wink each at other; hold the sweet jest up:
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,2,HELENA,4,"This sport, well carried, shall be chronicled."
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,2,HELENA,5,"If you have any pity, grace, or manners,"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,2,HELENA,6,You would not make me such an argument.
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,2,HELENA,7,But fare ye well: 'tis partly my own fault;
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,2,HELENA,8,Which death or absence soon shall remedy.
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,2,LYSANDER,1,"Stay, gentle Helena; hear my excuse:"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,2,LYSANDER,2,"My love, my life my soul, fair Helena!"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,2,HELENA,1,O excellent!
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,2,HERMIA,1,"Sweet, do not scorn her so."
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,2,DEMETRIUS,1,"If she cannot entreat, I can compel."
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,2,LYSANDER,1,Thou canst compel no more than she entreat:
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,2,LYSANDER,2,Thy threats have no more strength than her weak prayers.
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,2,LYSANDER,3,"Helen, I love thee; by my life, I do:"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,2,LYSANDER,4,"I swear by that which I will lose for thee,"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,2,LYSANDER,5,To prove him false that says I love thee not.
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,2,DEMETRIUS,1,I say I love thee more than he can do.
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,2,LYSANDER,1,"If thou say so, withdraw, and prove it too."
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,2,DEMETRIUS,1,"Quick, come!"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,2,HERMIA,1,"Lysander, whereto tends all this?"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,2,LYSANDER,1,"Away, you Ethiope!"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,2,DEMETRIUS,1,"No, no; he'll"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,2,DEMETRIUS,2,"Seem to break loose; take on as you would follow,"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,2,DEMETRIUS,3,"But yet come not: you are a tame man, go!"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,2,LYSANDER,1,"Hang off, thou cat, thou burr! vile thing, let loose,"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,2,LYSANDER,2,Or I will shake thee from me like a serpent!
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,2,HERMIA,1,Why are you grown so rude? what change is this?
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,2,HERMIA,2,"Sweet love,--"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,2,LYSANDER,1,"Thy love! out, tawny Tartar, out!"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,2,LYSANDER,2,"Out, loathed medicine! hated potion, hence!"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,2,HERMIA,1,Do you not jest?
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,2,HELENA,1,"Yes, sooth; and so do you."
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,2,LYSANDER,1,"Demetrius, I will keep my word with thee."
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,2,DEMETRIUS,1,"I would I had your bond, for I perceive"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,2,DEMETRIUS,2,A weak bond holds you: I'll not trust your word.
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,2,LYSANDER,1,"What, should I hurt her, strike her, kill her dead?"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,2,LYSANDER,2,"Although I hate her, I'll not harm her so."
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,2,HERMIA,1,"What, can you do me greater harm than hate?"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,2,HERMIA,2,"Hate me! wherefore? O me! what news, my love!"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,2,HERMIA,3,Am not I Hermia? are not you Lysander?
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,2,HERMIA,4,I am as fair now as I was erewhile.
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,2,HERMIA,5,Since night you loved me; yet since night you left
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,2,HERMIA,6,me:
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,2,HERMIA,7,"Why, then you left me--O, the gods forbid!--"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,2,HERMIA,8,"In earnest, shall I say?"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,2,LYSANDER,1,"Ay, by my life;"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,2,LYSANDER,2,And never did desire to see thee more.
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,2,LYSANDER,3,"Therefore be out of hope, of question, of doubt;"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,2,LYSANDER,4,"Be certain, nothing truer; 'tis no jest"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,2,LYSANDER,5,That I do hate thee and love Helena.
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,2,HERMIA,1,O me! you juggler! you canker-blossom!
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,2,HERMIA,2,"You thief of love! what, have you come by night"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,2,HERMIA,3,And stolen my love's heart from him?
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,2,HELENA,1,"Fine, i'faith!"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,2,HELENA,2,"Have you no modesty, no maiden shame,"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,2,HELENA,3,"No touch of bashfulness? What, will you tear"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,2,HELENA,4,Impatient answers from my gentle tongue?
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,2,HELENA,5,"Fie, fie! you counterfeit, you puppet, you!"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,2,HERMIA,1,"Puppet? why so? ay, that way goes the game."
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,2,HERMIA,2,Now I perceive that she hath made compare
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,2,HERMIA,3,Between our statures; she hath urged her height;
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,2,HERMIA,4,"And with her personage, her tall personage,"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,2,HERMIA,5,"Her height, forsooth, she hath prevail'd with him."
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,2,HERMIA,6,And are you grown so high in his esteem;
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,2,HERMIA,7,Because I am so dwarfish and so low?
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,2,HERMIA,8,"How low am I, thou painted maypole? speak;"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,2,HERMIA,9,How low am I? I am not yet so low
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,2,HERMIA,10,But that my nails can reach unto thine eyes.
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,2,HELENA,1,"I pray you, though you mock me, gentlemen,"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,2,HELENA,2,Let her not hurt me: I was never curst;
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,2,HELENA,3,I have no gift at all in shrewishness;
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,2,HELENA,4,I am a right maid for my cowardice:
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,2,HELENA,5,"Let her not strike me. You perhaps may think,"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,2,HELENA,6,"Because she is something lower than myself,"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,2,HELENA,7,That I can match her.
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,2,HERMIA,1,"Lower! hark, again."
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,2,HELENA,1,"Good Hermia, do not be so bitter with me."
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,2,HELENA,2,"I evermore did love you, Hermia,"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,2,HELENA,3,"Did ever keep your counsels, never wrong'd you;"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,2,HELENA,4,"Save that, in love unto Demetrius,"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,2,HELENA,5,I told him of your stealth unto this wood.
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,2,HELENA,6,He follow'd you; for love I follow'd him;
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,2,HELENA,7,But he hath chid me hence and threaten'd me
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,2,HELENA,8,"To strike me, spurn me, nay, to kill me too:"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,2,HELENA,9,"And now, so you will let me quiet go,"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,2,HELENA,10,To Athens will I bear my folly back
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,2,HELENA,11,And follow you no further: let me go:
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,2,HELENA,12,You see how simple and how fond I am.
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,2,HERMIA,1,"Why, get you gone: who is't that hinders you?"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,2,HELENA,1,"A foolish heart, that I leave here behind."
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,2,HERMIA,1,"What, with Lysander?"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,2,HELENA,1,With Demetrius.
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,2,LYSANDER,1,"Be not afraid; she shall not harm thee, Helena."
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,2,DEMETRIUS,1,"No, sir, she shall not, though you take her part."
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,2,HELENA,1,"O, when she's angry, she is keen and shrewd!"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,2,HELENA,2,She was a vixen when she went to school;
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,2,HELENA,3,"And though she be but little, she is fierce."
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,2,HERMIA,1,'Little' again! nothing but 'low' and 'little'!
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,2,HERMIA,2,Why will you suffer her to flout me thus?
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,2,HERMIA,3,Let me come to her.
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,2,LYSANDER,1,"Get you gone, you dwarf;"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,2,LYSANDER,2,"You minimus, of hindering knot-grass made;"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,2,LYSANDER,3,"You bead, you acorn."
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,2,DEMETRIUS,1,You are too officious
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,2,DEMETRIUS,2,In her behalf that scorns your services.
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,2,DEMETRIUS,3,Let her alone: speak not of Helena;
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,2,DEMETRIUS,4,"Take not her part; for, if thou dost intend"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,2,DEMETRIUS,5,"Never so little show of love to her,"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,2,DEMETRIUS,6,Thou shalt aby it.
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,2,LYSANDER,1,Now she holds me not;
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,2,LYSANDER,2,"Now follow, if thou darest, to try whose right,"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,2,LYSANDER,3,"Of thine or mine, is most in Helena."
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,2,DEMETRIUS,1,"Follow! nay, I'll go with thee, cheek by jole."
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,2,HERMIA,1,"You, mistress, all this coil is 'long of you:"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,2,HERMIA,2,"Nay, go not back."
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,2,HELENA,1,"I will not trust you, I,"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,2,HELENA,2,Nor longer stay in your curst company.
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,2,HELENA,3,"Your hands than mine are quicker for a fray,"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,2,HELENA,4,"My legs are longer though, to run away."
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,2,HERMIA,1,"I am amazed, and know not what to say."
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,2,OBERON,1,"This is thy negligence: still thou mistakest,"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,2,OBERON,2,Or else committ'st thy knaveries wilfully.
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,2,PUCK,1,"Believe me, king of shadows, I mistook."
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,2,PUCK,2,Did not you tell me I should know the man
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,2,PUCK,3,By the Athenian garment be had on?
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,2,PUCK,4,"And so far blameless proves my enterprise,"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,2,PUCK,5,That I have 'nointed an Athenian's eyes;
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,2,PUCK,6,And so far am I glad it so did sort
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,2,PUCK,7,As this their jangling I esteem a sport.
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,2,OBERON,1,Thou see'st these lovers seek a place to fight:
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,2,OBERON,2,"Hie therefore, Robin, overcast the night;"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,2,OBERON,3,The starry welkin cover thou anon
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,2,OBERON,4,"With drooping fog as black as Acheron,"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,2,OBERON,5,And lead these testy rivals so astray
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,2,OBERON,6,As one come not within another's way.
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,2,OBERON,7,"Like to Lysander sometime frame thy tongue,"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,2,OBERON,8,Then stir Demetrius up with bitter wrong;
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,2,OBERON,9,And sometime rail thou like Demetrius;
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,2,OBERON,10,"And from each other look thou lead them thus,"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,2,OBERON,11,Till o'er their brows death-counterfeiting sleep
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,2,OBERON,12,With leaden legs and batty wings doth creep:
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,2,OBERON,13,Then crush this herb into Lysander's eye;
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,2,OBERON,14,"Whose liquor hath this virtuous property,"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,2,OBERON,15,"To take from thence all error with his might,"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,2,OBERON,16,And make his eyeballs roll with wonted sight.
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,2,OBERON,17,"When they next wake, all this derision"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,2,OBERON,18,"Shall seem a dream and fruitless vision,"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,2,OBERON,19,"And back to Athens shall the lovers wend,"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,2,OBERON,20,With league whose date till death shall never end.
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,2,OBERON,21,"Whiles I in this affair do thee employ,"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,2,OBERON,22,I'll to my queen and beg her Indian boy;
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,2,OBERON,23,And then I will her charmed eye release
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,2,OBERON,24,"From monster's view, and all things shall be peace."
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,2,PUCK,1,"My fairy lord, this must be done with haste,"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,2,PUCK,2,"For night's swift dragons cut the clouds full fast,"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,2,PUCK,3,And yonder shines Aurora's harbinger;
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,2,PUCK,4,"At whose approach, ghosts, wandering here and there,"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,2,PUCK,5,"Troop home to churchyards: damned spirits all,"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,2,PUCK,6,"That in crossways and floods have burial,"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,2,PUCK,7,Already to their wormy beds are gone;
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,2,PUCK,8,"For fear lest day should look their shames upon,"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,2,PUCK,9,They willfully themselves exile from light
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,2,PUCK,10,And must for aye consort with black-brow'd night.
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,2,OBERON,1,But we are spirits of another sort:
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,2,OBERON,2,"I with the morning's love have oft made sport,"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,2,OBERON,3,"And, like a forester, the groves may tread,"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,2,OBERON,4,"Even till the eastern gate, all fiery-red,"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,2,OBERON,5,"Opening on Neptune with fair blessed beams,"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,2,OBERON,6,Turns into yellow gold his salt green streams.
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,2,OBERON,7,"But, notwithstanding, haste; make no delay:"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,2,OBERON,8,We may effect this business yet ere day.
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,2,PUCK,1,"Up and down, up and down,"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,2,PUCK,2,I will lead them up and down:
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,2,PUCK,3,I am fear'd in field and town:
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,2,PUCK,4,"Goblin, lead them up and down."
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,2,PUCK,5,Here comes one.
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,2,LYSANDER,1,"Where art thou, proud Demetrius? speak thou now."
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,2,PUCK,1,"Here, villain; drawn and ready. Where art thou?"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,2,LYSANDER,1,I will be with thee straight.
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,2,PUCK,1,"Follow me, then,"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,2,PUCK,2,To plainer ground.
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,2,DEMETRIUS,1,Lysander! speak again:
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,2,DEMETRIUS,2,"Thou runaway, thou coward, art thou fled?"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,2,DEMETRIUS,3,Speak! In some bush? Where dost thou hide thy head?
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,2,PUCK,1,"Thou coward, art thou bragging to the stars,"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,2,PUCK,2,"Telling the bushes that thou look'st for wars,"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,2,PUCK,3,"And wilt not come? Come, recreant; come, thou child;"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,2,PUCK,4,I'll whip thee with a rod: he is defiled
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,2,PUCK,5,That draws a sword on thee.
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,2,DEMETRIUS,1,"Yea, art thou there?"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,2,PUCK,1,Follow my voice: we'll try no manhood here.
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,2,LYSANDER,1,He goes before me and still dares me on:
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,2,LYSANDER,2,"When I come where he calls, then he is gone."
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,2,LYSANDER,3,The villain is much lighter-heel'd than I:
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,2,LYSANDER,4,"I follow'd fast, but faster he did fly;"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,2,LYSANDER,5,"That fallen am I in dark uneven way,"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,2,LYSANDER,6,And here will rest me.
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,2,LYSANDER,7,"Come, thou gentle day!"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,2,LYSANDER,8,"For if but once thou show me thy grey light,"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,2,LYSANDER,9,I'll find Demetrius and revenge this spite.
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,2,PUCK,1,"Ho, ho, ho! Coward, why comest thou not?"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,2,DEMETRIUS,1,"Abide me, if thou darest; for well I wot"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,2,DEMETRIUS,2,"Thou runn'st before me, shifting every place,"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,2,DEMETRIUS,3,"And darest not stand, nor look me in the face."
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,2,DEMETRIUS,4,Where art thou now?
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,2,PUCK,1,Come hither: I am here.
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,2,DEMETRIUS,1,"Nay, then, thou mock'st me. Thou shalt buy this dear,"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,2,DEMETRIUS,2,If ever I thy face by daylight see:
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,2,DEMETRIUS,3,"Now, go thy way. Faintness constraineth me"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,2,DEMETRIUS,4,To measure out my length on this cold bed.
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,2,DEMETRIUS,5,By day's approach look to be visited.
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,2,HELENA,1,"O weary night, O long and tedious night,"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,2,HELENA,2,"Abate thy hour! Shine comforts from the east,"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,2,HELENA,3,"That I may back to Athens by daylight,"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,2,HELENA,4,From these that my poor company detest:
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,2,HELENA,5,"And sleep, that sometimes shuts up sorrow's eye,"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,2,HELENA,6,Steal me awhile from mine own company.
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,2,PUCK,1,Yet but three? Come one more;
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,2,PUCK,2,Two of both kinds make up four.
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,2,PUCK,3,"Here she comes, curst and sad:"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,2,PUCK,4,"Cupid is a knavish lad,"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,2,PUCK,5,Thus to make poor females mad.
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,2,HERMIA,1,"Never so weary, never so in woe,"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,2,HERMIA,2,"Bedabbled with the dew and torn with briers,"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,2,HERMIA,3,"I can no further crawl, no further go;"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,2,HERMIA,4,My legs can keep no pace with my desires.
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,2,HERMIA,5,Here will I rest me till the break of day.
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,2,HERMIA,6,"Heavens shield Lysander, if they mean a fray!"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,2,PUCK,1,On the ground
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,2,PUCK,2,Sleep sound:
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,2,PUCK,3,I'll apply
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,2,PUCK,4,"To your eye,"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,2,PUCK,5,"Gentle lover, remedy."
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,2,PUCK,6,"When thou wakest,"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,2,PUCK,7,Thou takest
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,2,PUCK,8,True delight
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,2,PUCK,9,In the sight
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,2,PUCK,10,Of thy former lady's eye:
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,2,PUCK,11,"And the country proverb known,"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,2,PUCK,12,"That every man should take his own,"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,2,PUCK,13,In your waking shall be shown:
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,2,PUCK,14,Jack shall have Jill;
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,2,PUCK,15,Nought shall go ill;
A Midsummer Night's Dream,3,2,PUCK,16,"The man shall have his mare again, and all shall be well."
A Midsummer Night's Dream,4,1,TITANIA,1,"Come, sit thee down upon this flowery bed,"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,4,1,TITANIA,2,"While I thy amiable cheeks do coy,"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,4,1,TITANIA,3,"And stick musk-roses in thy sleek smooth head,"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,4,1,TITANIA,4,"And kiss thy fair large ears, my gentle joy."
A Midsummer Night's Dream,4,1,BOTTOM,1,Where's Peaseblossom?
A Midsummer Night's Dream,4,1,PEASEBLOSSOM,1,Ready.
A Midsummer Night's Dream,4,1,BOTTOM,1,Scratch my head Peaseblossom. Where's Mounsieur Cobweb?
A Midsummer Night's Dream,4,1,COBWEB,1,Ready.
A Midsummer Night's Dream,4,1,BOTTOM,1,"Mounsieur Cobweb, good mounsieur, get you your"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,4,1,BOTTOM,2,"weapons in your hand, and kill me a red-hipped"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,4,1,BOTTOM,3,"humble-bee on the top of a thistle; and, good"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,4,1,BOTTOM,4,"mounsieur, bring me the honey-bag. Do not fret"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,4,1,BOTTOM,5,"yourself too much in the action, mounsieur; and,"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,4,1,BOTTOM,6,"good mounsieur, have a care the honey-bag break not;"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,4,1,BOTTOM,7,I would be loath to have you overflown with a
A Midsummer Night's Dream,4,1,BOTTOM,8,"honey-bag, signior. Where's Mounsieur Mustardseed?"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,4,1,MUSTARDSEED,1,Ready.
A Midsummer Night's Dream,4,1,BOTTOM,1,"Give me your neaf, Mounsieur Mustardseed. Pray you,"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,4,1,BOTTOM,2,"leave your courtesy, good mounsieur."
A Midsummer Night's Dream,4,1,MUSTARDSEED,1,What's your Will?
A Midsummer Night's Dream,4,1,BOTTOM,1,"Nothing, good mounsieur, but to help Cavalery Cobweb"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,4,1,BOTTOM,2,"to scratch. I must to the barber's, monsieur; for"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,4,1,BOTTOM,3,methinks I am marvellous hairy about the face; and I
A Midsummer Night's Dream,4,1,BOTTOM,4,"am such a tender ass, if my hair do but tickle me,"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,4,1,BOTTOM,5,I must scratch.
A Midsummer Night's Dream,4,1,TITANIA,1,"What, wilt thou hear some music,"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,4,1,TITANIA,2,my sweet love?
A Midsummer Night's Dream,4,1,BOTTOM,1,I have a reasonable good ear in music. Let's have
A Midsummer Night's Dream,4,1,BOTTOM,2,the tongs and the bones.
A Midsummer Night's Dream,4,1,TITANIA,1,"Or say, sweet love, what thou desirest to eat."
A Midsummer Night's Dream,4,1,BOTTOM,1,"Truly, a peck of provender: I could munch your good"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,4,1,BOTTOM,2,dry oats. Methinks I have a great desire to a bottle
A Midsummer Night's Dream,4,1,BOTTOM,3,"of hay: good hay, sweet hay, hath no fellow."
A Midsummer Night's Dream,4,1,TITANIA,1,I have a venturous fairy that shall seek
A Midsummer Night's Dream,4,1,TITANIA,2,"The squirrel's hoard, and fetch thee new nuts."
A Midsummer Night's Dream,4,1,BOTTOM,1,I had rather have a handful or two of dried peas.
A Midsummer Night's Dream,4,1,BOTTOM,2,"But, I pray you, let none of your people stir me: I"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,4,1,BOTTOM,3,have an exposition of sleep come upon me.
A Midsummer Night's Dream,4,1,TITANIA,1,"Sleep thou, and I will wind thee in my arms."
A Midsummer Night's Dream,4,1,TITANIA,2,"Fairies, begone, and be all ways away."
A Midsummer Night's Dream,4,1,TITANIA,3,So doth the woodbine the sweet honeysuckle
A Midsummer Night's Dream,4,1,TITANIA,4,Gently entwist; the female ivy so
A Midsummer Night's Dream,4,1,TITANIA,5,Enrings the barky fingers of the elm.
A Midsummer Night's Dream,4,1,TITANIA,6,"O, how I love thee! how I dote on thee!"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,4,1,OBERON,1,See'st thou this sweet sight?
A Midsummer Night's Dream,4,1,OBERON,2,Her dotage now I do begin to pity:
A Midsummer Night's Dream,4,1,OBERON,3,"For, meeting her of late behind the wood,"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,4,1,OBERON,4,"Seeking sweet favours from this hateful fool,"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,4,1,OBERON,5,I did upbraid her and fall out with her;
A Midsummer Night's Dream,4,1,OBERON,6,For she his hairy temples then had rounded
A Midsummer Night's Dream,4,1,OBERON,7,With a coronet of fresh and fragrant flowers;
A Midsummer Night's Dream,4,1,OBERON,8,"And that same dew, which sometime on the buds"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,4,1,OBERON,9,"Was wont to swell like round and orient pearls,"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,4,1,OBERON,10,Stood now within the pretty flowerets' eyes
A Midsummer Night's Dream,4,1,OBERON,11,Like tears that did their own disgrace bewail.
A Midsummer Night's Dream,4,1,OBERON,12,When I had at my pleasure taunted her
A Midsummer Night's Dream,4,1,OBERON,13,"And she in mild terms begg'd my patience,"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,4,1,OBERON,14,I then did ask of her her changeling child;
A Midsummer Night's Dream,4,1,OBERON,15,"Which straight she gave me, and her fairy sent"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,4,1,OBERON,16,To bear him to my bower in fairy land.
A Midsummer Night's Dream,4,1,OBERON,17,"And now I have the boy, I will undo"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,4,1,OBERON,18,This hateful imperfection of her eyes:
A Midsummer Night's Dream,4,1,OBERON,19,"And, gentle Puck, take this transformed scalp"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,4,1,OBERON,20,From off the head of this Athenian swain;
A Midsummer Night's Dream,4,1,OBERON,21,"That, he awaking when the other do,"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,4,1,OBERON,22,May all to Athens back again repair
A Midsummer Night's Dream,4,1,OBERON,23,And think no more of this night's accidents
A Midsummer Night's Dream,4,1,OBERON,24,But as the fierce vexation of a dream.
A Midsummer Night's Dream,4,1,OBERON,25,But first I will release the fairy queen.
A Midsummer Night's Dream,4,1,OBERON,26,Be as thou wast wont to be;
A Midsummer Night's Dream,4,1,OBERON,27,See as thou wast wont to see:
A Midsummer Night's Dream,4,1,OBERON,28,Dian's bud o'er Cupid's flower
A Midsummer Night's Dream,4,1,OBERON,29,Hath such force and blessed power.
A Midsummer Night's Dream,4,1,OBERON,30,"Now, my Titania; wake you, my sweet queen."
A Midsummer Night's Dream,4,1,TITANIA,1,My Oberon! what visions have I seen!
A Midsummer Night's Dream,4,1,TITANIA,2,Methought I was enamour'd of an ass.
A Midsummer Night's Dream,4,1,OBERON,1,There lies your love.
A Midsummer Night's Dream,4,1,TITANIA,1,How came these things to pass?
A Midsummer Night's Dream,4,1,TITANIA,2,"O, how mine eyes do loathe his visage now!"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,4,1,OBERON,1,"Silence awhile. Robin, take off this head."
A Midsummer Night's Dream,4,1,OBERON,2,"Titania, music call; and strike more dead"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,4,1,OBERON,3,Than common sleep of all these five the sense.
A Midsummer Night's Dream,4,1,TITANIA,1,"Music, ho! music, such as charmeth sleep!"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,4,1,PUCK,1,"Now, when thou wakest, with thine"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,4,1,PUCK,2,own fool's eyes peep.
A Midsummer Night's Dream,4,1,OBERON,1,"Sound, music! Come, my queen, take hands with me,"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,4,1,OBERON,2,And rock the ground whereon these sleepers be.
A Midsummer Night's Dream,4,1,OBERON,3,"Now thou and I are new in amity,"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,4,1,OBERON,4,And will to-morrow midnight solemnly
A Midsummer Night's Dream,4,1,OBERON,5,"Dance in Duke Theseus' house triumphantly,"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,4,1,OBERON,6,And bless it to all fair prosperity:
A Midsummer Night's Dream,4,1,OBERON,7,There shall the pairs of faithful lovers be
A Midsummer Night's Dream,4,1,OBERON,8,"Wedded, with Theseus, all in jollity."
A Midsummer Night's Dream,4,1,PUCK,1,"Fairy king, attend, and mark:"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,4,1,PUCK,2,I do hear the morning lark.
A Midsummer Night's Dream,4,1,OBERON,1,"Then, my queen, in silence sad,"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,4,1,OBERON,2,Trip we after the night's shade:
A Midsummer Night's Dream,4,1,OBERON,3,"We the globe can compass soon,"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,4,1,OBERON,4,Swifter than the wandering moon.
A Midsummer Night's Dream,4,1,TITANIA,1,"Come, my lord, and in our flight"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,4,1,TITANIA,2,Tell me how it came this night
A Midsummer Night's Dream,4,1,TITANIA,3,That I sleeping here was found
A Midsummer Night's Dream,4,1,TITANIA,4,With these mortals on the ground.
A Midsummer Night's Dream,4,1,THESEUS,1,"Go, one of you, find out the forester;"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,4,1,THESEUS,2,For now our observation is perform'd;
A Midsummer Night's Dream,4,1,THESEUS,3,"And since we have the vaward of the day,"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,4,1,THESEUS,4,My love shall hear the music of my hounds.
A Midsummer Night's Dream,4,1,THESEUS,5,Uncouple in the western valley; let them go:
A Midsummer Night's Dream,4,1,THESEUS,6,"Dispatch, I say, and find the forester."
A Midsummer Night's Dream,4,1,THESEUS,7,"We will, fair queen, up to the mountain's top,"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,4,1,THESEUS,8,And mark the musical confusion
A Midsummer Night's Dream,4,1,THESEUS,9,Of hounds and echo in conjunction.
A Midsummer Night's Dream,4,1,HIPPOLYTA,1,"I was with Hercules and Cadmus once,"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,4,1,HIPPOLYTA,2,When in a wood of Crete they bay'd the bear
A Midsummer Night's Dream,4,1,HIPPOLYTA,3,With hounds of Sparta: never did I hear
A Midsummer Night's Dream,4,1,HIPPOLYTA,4,"Such gallant chiding: for, besides the groves,"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,4,1,HIPPOLYTA,5,"The skies, the fountains, every region near"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,4,1,HIPPOLYTA,6,Seem'd all one mutual cry: I never heard
A Midsummer Night's Dream,4,1,HIPPOLYTA,7,"So musical a discord, such sweet thunder."
A Midsummer Night's Dream,4,1,THESEUS,1,"My hounds are bred out of the Spartan kind,"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,4,1,THESEUS,2,"So flew'd, so sanded, and their heads are hung"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,4,1,THESEUS,3,With ears that sweep away the morning dew;
A Midsummer Night's Dream,4,1,THESEUS,4,"Crook-knee'd, and dew-lapp'd like Thessalian bulls;"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,4,1,THESEUS,5,"Slow in pursuit, but match'd in mouth like bells,"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,4,1,THESEUS,6,Each under each. A cry more tuneable
A Midsummer Night's Dream,4,1,THESEUS,7,"Was never holla'd to, nor cheer'd with horn,"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,4,1,THESEUS,8,"In Crete, in Sparta, nor in Thessaly:"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,4,1,THESEUS,9,"Judge when you hear. But, soft! what nymphs are these?"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,4,1,EGEUS,1,"My lord, this is my daughter here asleep;"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,4,1,EGEUS,2,"And this, Lysander; this Demetrius is;"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,4,1,EGEUS,3,"This Helena, old Nedar's Helena:"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,4,1,EGEUS,4,I wonder of their being here together.
A Midsummer Night's Dream,4,1,THESEUS,1,No doubt they rose up early to observe
A Midsummer Night's Dream,4,1,THESEUS,2,"The rite of May, and hearing our intent,"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,4,1,THESEUS,3,Came here in grace our solemnity.
A Midsummer Night's Dream,4,1,THESEUS,4,"But speak, Egeus; is not this the day"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,4,1,THESEUS,5,That Hermia should give answer of her choice?
A Midsummer Night's Dream,4,1,EGEUS,1,"It is, my lord."
A Midsummer Night's Dream,4,1,THESEUS,1,"Go, bid the huntsmen wake them with their horns."
A Midsummer Night's Dream,4,1,THESEUS,2,"Good morrow, friends. Saint Valentine is past:"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,4,1,THESEUS,3,Begin these wood-birds but to couple now?
A Midsummer Night's Dream,4,1,LYSANDER,1,"Pardon, my lord."
A Midsummer Night's Dream,4,1,THESEUS,1,"I pray you all, stand up."
A Midsummer Night's Dream,4,1,THESEUS,2,I know you two are rival enemies:
A Midsummer Night's Dream,4,1,THESEUS,3,"How comes this gentle concord in the world,"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,4,1,THESEUS,4,"That hatred is so far from jealousy,"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,4,1,THESEUS,5,"To sleep by hate, and fear no enmity?"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,4,1,LYSANDER,1,"My lord, I shall reply amazedly,"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,4,1,LYSANDER,2,"Half sleep, half waking: but as yet, I swear,"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,4,1,LYSANDER,3,I cannot truly say how I came here;
A Midsummer Night's Dream,4,1,LYSANDER,4,"But, as I think,--for truly would I speak,"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,4,1,LYSANDER,5,"And now do I bethink me, so it is,--"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,4,1,LYSANDER,6,I came with Hermia hither: our intent
A Midsummer Night's Dream,4,1,LYSANDER,7,"Was to be gone from Athens, where we might,"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,4,1,LYSANDER,8,Without the peril of the Athenian law.
A Midsummer Night's Dream,4,1,EGEUS,1,"Enough, enough, my lord; you have enough:"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,4,1,EGEUS,2,"I beg the law, the law, upon his head."
A Midsummer Night's Dream,4,1,EGEUS,3,"They would have stolen away; they would, Demetrius,"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,4,1,EGEUS,4,"Thereby to have defeated you and me,"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,4,1,EGEUS,5,"You of your wife and me of my consent,"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,4,1,EGEUS,6,Of my consent that she should be your wife.
A Midsummer Night's Dream,4,1,DEMETRIUS,1,"My lord, fair Helen told me of their stealth,"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,4,1,DEMETRIUS,2,Of this their purpose hither to this wood;
A Midsummer Night's Dream,4,1,DEMETRIUS,3,"And I in fury hither follow'd them,"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,4,1,DEMETRIUS,4,Fair Helena in fancy following me.
A Midsummer Night's Dream,4,1,DEMETRIUS,5,"But, my good lord, I wot not by what power,--"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,4,1,DEMETRIUS,6,"But by some power it is,--my love to Hermia,"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,4,1,DEMETRIUS,7,"Melted as the snow, seems to me now"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,4,1,DEMETRIUS,8,As the remembrance of an idle gaud
A Midsummer Night's Dream,4,1,DEMETRIUS,9,Which in my childhood I did dote upon;
A Midsummer Night's Dream,4,1,DEMETRIUS,10,"And all the faith, the virtue of my heart,"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,4,1,DEMETRIUS,11,"The object and the pleasure of mine eye,"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,4,1,DEMETRIUS,12,"Is only Helena. To her, my lord,"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,4,1,DEMETRIUS,13,Was I betroth'd ere I saw Hermia:
A Midsummer Night's Dream,4,1,DEMETRIUS,14,"But, like in sickness, did I loathe this food;"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,4,1,DEMETRIUS,15,"But, as in health, come to my natural taste,"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,4,1,DEMETRIUS,16,"Now I do wish it, love it, long for it,"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,4,1,DEMETRIUS,17,And will for evermore be true to it.
A Midsummer Night's Dream,4,1,THESEUS,1,"Fair lovers, you are fortunately met:"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,4,1,THESEUS,2,Of this discourse we more will hear anon.
A Midsummer Night's Dream,4,1,THESEUS,3,"Egeus, I will overbear your will;"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,4,1,THESEUS,4,For in the temple by and by with us
A Midsummer Night's Dream,4,1,THESEUS,5,These couples shall eternally be knit:
A Midsummer Night's Dream,4,1,THESEUS,6,"And, for the morning now is something worn,"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,4,1,THESEUS,7,Our purposed hunting shall be set aside.
A Midsummer Night's Dream,4,1,THESEUS,8,"Away with us to Athens; three and three,"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,4,1,THESEUS,9,We'll hold a feast in great solemnity.
A Midsummer Night's Dream,4,1,THESEUS,10,"Come, Hippolyta."
A Midsummer Night's Dream,4,1,DEMETRIUS,1,"These things seem small and undistinguishable,"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,4,1,HERMIA,1,"Methinks I see these things with parted eye,"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,4,1,HERMIA,2,When every thing seems double.
A Midsummer Night's Dream,4,1,HELENA,1,So methinks:
A Midsummer Night's Dream,4,1,HELENA,2,"And I have found Demetrius like a jewel,"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,4,1,HELENA,3,"Mine own, and not mine own."
A Midsummer Night's Dream,4,1,DEMETRIUS,1,Are you sure
A Midsummer Night's Dream,4,1,DEMETRIUS,2,That we are awake? It seems to me
A Midsummer Night's Dream,4,1,DEMETRIUS,3,"That yet we sleep, we dream. Do not you think"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,4,1,DEMETRIUS,4,"The duke was here, and bid us follow him?"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,4,1,HERMIA,1,Yea; and my father.
A Midsummer Night's Dream,4,1,HELENA,1,And Hippolyta.
A Midsummer Night's Dream,4,1,LYSANDER,1,And he did bid us follow to the temple.
A Midsummer Night's Dream,4,1,DEMETRIUS,1,"Why, then, we are awake: let's follow him"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,4,1,DEMETRIUS,2,And by the way let us recount our dreams.
A Midsummer Night's Dream,4,1,BOTTOM,1,"answer: my next is, 'Most fair Pyramus.' Heigh-ho!"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,4,1,BOTTOM,2,"Peter Quince! Flute, the bellows-mender! Snout,"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,4,1,BOTTOM,3,"the tinker! Starveling! God's my life, stolen"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,4,1,BOTTOM,4,"hence, and left me asleep! I have had a most rare"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,4,1,BOTTOM,5,"vision. I have had a dream, past the wit of man to"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,4,1,BOTTOM,6,"say what dream it was: man is but an ass, if he go"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,4,1,BOTTOM,7,about to expound this dream. Methought I was--there
A Midsummer Night's Dream,4,1,BOTTOM,8,"is no man can tell what. Methought I was,--and"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,4,1,BOTTOM,9,"methought I had,--but man is but a patched fool, if"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,4,1,BOTTOM,10,he will offer to say what methought I had. The eye
A Midsummer Night's Dream,4,1,BOTTOM,11,"of man hath not heard, the ear of man hath not"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,4,1,BOTTOM,12,"seen, man's hand is not able to taste, his tongue"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,4,1,BOTTOM,13,"to conceive, nor his heart to report, what my dream"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,4,1,BOTTOM,14,was. I will get Peter Quince to write a ballad of
A Midsummer Night's Dream,4,1,BOTTOM,15,"this dream: it shall be called Bottom's Dream,"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,4,1,BOTTOM,16,because it hath no bottom; and I will sing it in the
A Midsummer Night's Dream,4,1,BOTTOM,17,"latter end of a play, before the duke:"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,4,1,BOTTOM,18,"peradventure, to make it the more gracious, I shall"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,4,1,BOTTOM,19,sing it at her death.
A Midsummer Night's Dream,4,2,QUINCE,1,Have you sent to Bottom's house? is he come home yet?
A Midsummer Night's Dream,4,2,STARVELING,1,He cannot be heard of. Out of doubt he is
A Midsummer Night's Dream,4,2,STARVELING,2,transported.
A Midsummer Night's Dream,4,2,FLUTE,1,"If he come not, then the play is marred: it goes"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,4,2,FLUTE,2,"not forward, doth it?"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,4,2,QUINCE,1,It is not possible: you have not a man in all
A Midsummer Night's Dream,4,2,QUINCE,2,Athens able to discharge Pyramus but he.
A Midsummer Night's Dream,4,2,FLUTE,1,"No, he hath simply the best wit of any handicraft"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,4,2,FLUTE,2,man in Athens.
A Midsummer Night's Dream,4,2,QUINCE,1,Yea and the best person too; and he is a very
A Midsummer Night's Dream,4,2,QUINCE,2,paramour for a sweet voice.
A Midsummer Night's Dream,4,2,FLUTE,1,"You must say 'paragon:' a paramour is, God bless us,"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,4,2,FLUTE,2,a thing of naught.
A Midsummer Night's Dream,4,2,SNUG,1,"Masters, the duke is coming from the temple, and"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,4,2,SNUG,2,there is two or three lords and ladies more married:
A Midsummer Night's Dream,4,2,SNUG,3,"if our sport had gone forward, we had all been made"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,4,2,SNUG,4,men.
A Midsummer Night's Dream,4,2,FLUTE,1,O sweet bully Bottom! Thus hath he lost sixpence a
A Midsummer Night's Dream,4,2,FLUTE,2,day during his life; he could not have 'scaped
A Midsummer Night's Dream,4,2,FLUTE,3,sixpence a day: an the duke had not given him
A Midsummer Night's Dream,4,2,FLUTE,4,"sixpence a day for playing Pyramus, I'll be hanged;"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,4,2,FLUTE,5,he would have deserved it: sixpence a day in
A Midsummer Night's Dream,4,2,FLUTE,6,"Pyramus, or nothing."
A Midsummer Night's Dream,4,2,BOTTOM,1,Where are these lads? where are these hearts?
A Midsummer Night's Dream,4,2,QUINCE,1,Bottom! O most courageous day! O most happy hour!
A Midsummer Night's Dream,4,2,BOTTOM,1,"Masters, I am to discourse wonders: but ask me not"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,4,2,BOTTOM,2,"what; for if I tell you, I am no true Athenian. I"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,4,2,BOTTOM,3,"will tell you every thing, right as it fell out."
A Midsummer Night's Dream,4,2,QUINCE,1,"Let us hear, sweet Bottom."
A Midsummer Night's Dream,4,2,BOTTOM,1,"Not a word of me. All that I will tell you is, that"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,4,2,BOTTOM,2,"the duke hath dined. Get your apparel together,"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,4,2,BOTTOM,3,"good strings to your beards, new ribbons to your"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,4,2,BOTTOM,4,pumps; meet presently at the palace; every man look
A Midsummer Night's Dream,4,2,BOTTOM,5,"o'er his part; for the short and the long is, our"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,4,2,BOTTOM,6,"play is preferred. In any case, let Thisby have"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,4,2,BOTTOM,7,clean linen; and let not him that plays the lion
A Midsummer Night's Dream,4,2,BOTTOM,8,"pair his nails, for they shall hang out for the"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,4,2,BOTTOM,9,"lion's claws. And, most dear actors, eat no onions"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,4,2,BOTTOM,10,"nor garlic, for we are to utter sweet breath; and I"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,4,2,BOTTOM,11,"do not doubt but to hear them say, it is a sweet"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,4,2,BOTTOM,12,"comedy. No more words: away! go, away!"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,5,1,HIPPOLYTA,1,"'Tis strange my Theseus, that these"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,5,1,HIPPOLYTA,2,lovers speak of.
A Midsummer Night's Dream,5,1,THESEUS,1,More strange than true: I never may believe
A Midsummer Night's Dream,5,1,THESEUS,2,"These antique fables, nor these fairy toys."
A Midsummer Night's Dream,5,1,THESEUS,3,"Lovers and madmen have such seething brains,"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,5,1,THESEUS,4,"Such shaping fantasies, that apprehend"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,5,1,THESEUS,5,More than cool reason ever comprehends.
A Midsummer Night's Dream,5,1,THESEUS,6,"The lunatic, the lover and the poet"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,5,1,THESEUS,7,Are of imagination all compact:
A Midsummer Night's Dream,5,1,THESEUS,8,"One sees more devils than vast hell can hold,"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,5,1,THESEUS,9,"That is, the madman: the lover, all as frantic,"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,5,1,THESEUS,10,Sees Helen's beauty in a brow of Egypt:
A Midsummer Night's Dream,5,1,THESEUS,11,"The poet's eye, in fine frenzy rolling,"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,5,1,THESEUS,12,"Doth glance from heaven to earth, from earth to heaven;"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,5,1,THESEUS,13,And as imagination bodies forth
A Midsummer Night's Dream,5,1,THESEUS,14,"The forms of things unknown, the poet's pen"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,5,1,THESEUS,15,Turns them to shapes and gives to airy nothing
A Midsummer Night's Dream,5,1,THESEUS,16,A local habitation and a name.
A Midsummer Night's Dream,5,1,THESEUS,17,"Such tricks hath strong imagination,"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,5,1,THESEUS,18,"That if it would but apprehend some joy,"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,5,1,THESEUS,19,It comprehends some bringer of that joy;
A Midsummer Night's Dream,5,1,THESEUS,20,"Or in the night, imagining some fear,"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,5,1,THESEUS,21,How easy is a bush supposed a bear!
A Midsummer Night's Dream,5,1,HIPPOLYTA,1,"But all the story of the night told over,"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,5,1,HIPPOLYTA,2,"And all their minds transfigured so together,"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,5,1,HIPPOLYTA,3,More witnesseth than fancy's images
A Midsummer Night's Dream,5,1,HIPPOLYTA,4,And grows to something of great constancy;
A Midsummer Night's Dream,5,1,HIPPOLYTA,5,"But, howsoever, strange and admirable."
A Midsummer Night's Dream,5,1,THESEUS,1,"Here come the lovers, full of joy and mirth."
A Midsummer Night's Dream,5,1,THESEUS,2,"Joy, gentle friends! joy and fresh days of love"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,5,1,THESEUS,3,Accompany your hearts!
A Midsummer Night's Dream,5,1,LYSANDER,1,More than to us
A Midsummer Night's Dream,5,1,LYSANDER,2,"Wait in your royal walks, your board, your bed!"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,5,1,THESEUS,1,"Come now; what masques, what dances shall we have,"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,5,1,THESEUS,2,To wear away this long age of three hours
A Midsummer Night's Dream,5,1,THESEUS,3,Between our after-supper and bed-time?
A Midsummer Night's Dream,5,1,THESEUS,4,Where is our usual manager of mirth?
A Midsummer Night's Dream,5,1,THESEUS,5,"What revels are in hand? Is there no play,"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,5,1,THESEUS,6,To ease the anguish of a torturing hour?
A Midsummer Night's Dream,5,1,THESEUS,7,Call Philostrate.
A Midsummer Night's Dream,5,1,PHILOSTRATE,1,"Here, mighty Theseus."
A Midsummer Night's Dream,5,1,THESEUS,1,"Say, what abridgement have you for this evening?"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,5,1,THESEUS,2,What masque? what music? How shall we beguile
A Midsummer Night's Dream,5,1,THESEUS,3,"The lazy time, if not with some delight?"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,5,1,PHILOSTRATE,1,There is a brief how many sports are ripe:
A Midsummer Night's Dream,5,1,PHILOSTRATE,2,Make choice of which your highness will see first.
A Midsummer Night's Dream,5,1,THESEUS,1,By an Athenian eunuch to the harp.'
A Midsummer Night's Dream,5,1,THESEUS,2,"We'll none of that: that have I told my love,"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,5,1,THESEUS,3,In glory of my kinsman Hercules.
A Midsummer Night's Dream,5,1,THESEUS,4,"'The riot of the tipsy Bacchanals,"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,5,1,THESEUS,5,Tearing the Thracian singer in their rage.'
A Midsummer Night's Dream,5,1,THESEUS,6,That is an old device; and it was play'd
A Midsummer Night's Dream,5,1,THESEUS,7,When I from Thebes came last a conqueror.
A Midsummer Night's Dream,5,1,THESEUS,8,'The thrice three Muses mourning for the death
A Midsummer Night's Dream,5,1,THESEUS,9,"Of Learning, late deceased in beggary.'"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,5,1,THESEUS,10,"That is some satire, keen and critical,"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,5,1,THESEUS,11,Not sorting with a nuptial ceremony.
A Midsummer Night's Dream,5,1,THESEUS,12,'A tedious brief scene of young Pyramus
A Midsummer Night's Dream,5,1,THESEUS,13,And his love Thisbe; very tragical mirth.'
A Midsummer Night's Dream,5,1,THESEUS,14,Merry and tragical! tedious and brief!
A Midsummer Night's Dream,5,1,THESEUS,15,"That is, hot ice and wondrous strange snow."
A Midsummer Night's Dream,5,1,THESEUS,16,How shall we find the concord of this discord?
A Midsummer Night's Dream,5,1,PHILOSTRATE,1,"A play there is, my lord, some ten words long,"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,5,1,PHILOSTRATE,2,Which is as brief as I have known a play;
A Midsummer Night's Dream,5,1,PHILOSTRATE,3,"But by ten words, my lord, it is too long,"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,5,1,PHILOSTRATE,4,Which makes it tedious; for in all the play
A Midsummer Night's Dream,5,1,PHILOSTRATE,5,"There is not one word apt, one player fitted:"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,5,1,PHILOSTRATE,6,"And tragical, my noble lord, it is;"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,5,1,PHILOSTRATE,7,For Pyramus therein doth kill himself.
A Midsummer Night's Dream,5,1,PHILOSTRATE,8,"Which, when I saw rehearsed, I must confess,"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,5,1,PHILOSTRATE,9,Made mine eyes water; but more merry tears
A Midsummer Night's Dream,5,1,PHILOSTRATE,10,The passion of loud laughter never shed.
A Midsummer Night's Dream,5,1,THESEUS,1,What are they that do play it?
A Midsummer Night's Dream,5,1,PHILOSTRATE,1,"Hard-handed men that work in Athens here,"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,5,1,PHILOSTRATE,2,"Which never labour'd in their minds till now,"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,5,1,PHILOSTRATE,3,And now have toil'd their unbreathed memories
A Midsummer Night's Dream,5,1,PHILOSTRATE,4,"With this same play, against your nuptial."
A Midsummer Night's Dream,5,1,THESEUS,1,And we will hear it.
A Midsummer Night's Dream,5,1,PHILOSTRATE,1,"No, my noble lord;"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,5,1,PHILOSTRATE,2,"It is not for you: I have heard it over,"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,5,1,PHILOSTRATE,3,"And it is nothing, nothing in the world;"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,5,1,PHILOSTRATE,4,"Unless you can find sport in their intents,"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,5,1,PHILOSTRATE,5,"Extremely stretch'd and conn'd with cruel pain,"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,5,1,PHILOSTRATE,6,To do you service.
A Midsummer Night's Dream,5,1,THESEUS,1,I will hear that play;
A Midsummer Night's Dream,5,1,THESEUS,2,"For never anything can be amiss,"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,5,1,THESEUS,3,When simpleness and duty tender it.
A Midsummer Night's Dream,5,1,THESEUS,4,"Go, bring them in: and take your places, ladies."
A Midsummer Night's Dream,5,1,HIPPOLYTA,1,I love not to see wretchedness o'er charged
A Midsummer Night's Dream,5,1,HIPPOLYTA,2,And duty in his service perishing.
A Midsummer Night's Dream,5,1,THESEUS,1,"Why, gentle sweet, you shall see no such thing."
A Midsummer Night's Dream,5,1,HIPPOLYTA,1,He says they can do nothing in this kind.
A Midsummer Night's Dream,5,1,THESEUS,1,"The kinder we, to give them thanks for nothing."
A Midsummer Night's Dream,5,1,THESEUS,2,Our sport shall be to take what they mistake:
A Midsummer Night's Dream,5,1,THESEUS,3,"And what poor duty cannot do, noble respect"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,5,1,THESEUS,4,"Takes it in might, not merit."
A Midsummer Night's Dream,5,1,THESEUS,5,"Where I have come, great clerks have purposed"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,5,1,THESEUS,6,To greet me with premeditated welcomes;
A Midsummer Night's Dream,5,1,THESEUS,7,"Where I have seen them shiver and look pale,"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,5,1,THESEUS,8,"Make periods in the midst of sentences,"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,5,1,THESEUS,9,Throttle their practised accent in their fears
A Midsummer Night's Dream,5,1,THESEUS,10,"And in conclusion dumbly have broke off,"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,5,1,THESEUS,11,"Not paying me a welcome. Trust me, sweet,"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,5,1,THESEUS,12,Out of this silence yet I pick'd a welcome;
A Midsummer Night's Dream,5,1,THESEUS,13,And in the modesty of fearful duty
A Midsummer Night's Dream,5,1,THESEUS,14,I read as much as from the rattling tongue
A Midsummer Night's Dream,5,1,THESEUS,15,Of saucy and audacious eloquence.
A Midsummer Night's Dream,5,1,THESEUS,16,"Love, therefore, and tongue-tied simplicity"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,5,1,THESEUS,17,"In least speak most, to my capacity."
A Midsummer Night's Dream,5,1,PHILOSTRATE,1,"So please your grace, the Prologue is address'd."
A Midsummer Night's Dream,5,1,THESEUS,1,Let him approach.
A Midsummer Night's Dream,5,1,PROLOGUE,1,"If we offend, it is with our good will."
A Midsummer Night's Dream,5,1,PROLOGUE,2,"That you should think, we come not to offend,"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,5,1,PROLOGUE,3,"But with good will. To show our simple skill,"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,5,1,PROLOGUE,4,That is the true beginning of our end.
A Midsummer Night's Dream,5,1,PROLOGUE,5,Consider then we come but in despite.
A Midsummer Night's Dream,5,1,PROLOGUE,6,"We do not come as minding to contest you,"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,5,1,PROLOGUE,7,Our true intent is. All for your delight
A Midsummer Night's Dream,5,1,PROLOGUE,8,"We are not here. That you should here repent you,"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,5,1,PROLOGUE,9,The actors are at hand and by their show
A Midsummer Night's Dream,5,1,PROLOGUE,10,You shall know all that you are like to know.
A Midsummer Night's Dream,5,1,THESEUS,1,This fellow doth not stand upon points.
A Midsummer Night's Dream,5,1,LYSANDER,1,He hath rid his prologue like a rough colt; he knows
A Midsummer Night's Dream,5,1,LYSANDER,2,"not the stop. A good moral, my lord: it is not"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,5,1,LYSANDER,3,"enough to speak, but to speak true."
A Midsummer Night's Dream,5,1,HIPPOLYTA,1,Indeed he hath played on his prologue like a child
A Midsummer Night's Dream,5,1,HIPPOLYTA,2,"on a recorder; a sound, but not in government."
A Midsummer Night's Dream,5,1,THESEUS,1,"His speech, was like a tangled chain; nothing"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,5,1,THESEUS,2,"impaired, but all disordered. Who is next?"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,5,1,PROLOGUE,1,"Gentles, perchance you wonder at this show;"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,5,1,PROLOGUE,2,"But wonder on, till truth make all things plain."
A Midsummer Night's Dream,5,1,PROLOGUE,3,"This man is Pyramus, if you would know;"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,5,1,PROLOGUE,4,This beauteous lady Thisby is certain.
A Midsummer Night's Dream,5,1,PROLOGUE,5,"This man, with lime and rough-cast, doth present"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,5,1,PROLOGUE,6,"Wall, that vile Wall which did these lovers sunder;"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,5,1,PROLOGUE,7,"And through Wall's chink, poor souls, they are content"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,5,1,PROLOGUE,8,To whisper. At the which let no man wonder.
A Midsummer Night's Dream,5,1,PROLOGUE,9,"This man, with lanthorn, dog, and bush of thorn,"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,5,1,PROLOGUE,10,"Presenteth Moonshine; for, if you will know,"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,5,1,PROLOGUE,11,By moonshine did these lovers think no scorn
A Midsummer Night's Dream,5,1,PROLOGUE,12,"To meet at Ninus' tomb, there, there to woo."
A Midsummer Night's Dream,5,1,PROLOGUE,13,"This grisly beast, which Lion hight by name,"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,5,1,PROLOGUE,14,"The trusty Thisby, coming first by night,"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,5,1,PROLOGUE,15,"Did scare away, or rather did affright;"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,5,1,PROLOGUE,16,"And, as she fled, her mantle she did fall,"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,5,1,PROLOGUE,17,Which Lion vile with bloody mouth did stain.
A Midsummer Night's Dream,5,1,PROLOGUE,18,"Anon comes Pyramus, sweet youth and tall,"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,5,1,PROLOGUE,19,And finds his trusty Thisby's mantle slain:
A Midsummer Night's Dream,5,1,PROLOGUE,20,"Whereat, with blade, with bloody blameful blade,"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,5,1,PROLOGUE,21,He bravely broach'd is boiling bloody breast;
A Midsummer Night's Dream,5,1,PROLOGUE,22,"And Thisby, tarrying in mulberry shade,"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,5,1,PROLOGUE,23,"His dagger drew, and died. For all the rest,"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,5,1,PROLOGUE,24,"Let Lion, Moonshine, Wall, and lovers twain"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,5,1,PROLOGUE,25,"At large discourse, while here they do remain."
A Midsummer Night's Dream,5,1,THESEUS,1,I wonder if the lion be to speak.
A Midsummer Night's Dream,5,1,DEMETRIUS,1,"No wonder, my lord: one lion may, when many asses do."
A Midsummer Night's Dream,5,1,WALL,1,In this same interlude it doth befall
A Midsummer Night's Dream,5,1,WALL,2,"That I, one Snout by name, present a wall;"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,5,1,WALL,3,"And such a wall, as I would have you think,"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,5,1,WALL,4,"That had in it a crannied hole or chink,"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,5,1,WALL,5,"Through which the lovers, Pyramus and Thisby,"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,5,1,WALL,6,Did whisper often very secretly.
A Midsummer Night's Dream,5,1,WALL,7,"This loam, this rough-cast and this stone doth show"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,5,1,WALL,8,That I am that same wall; the truth is so:
A Midsummer Night's Dream,5,1,WALL,9,"And this the cranny is, right and sinister,"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,5,1,WALL,10,Through which the fearful lovers are to whisper.
A Midsummer Night's Dream,5,1,THESEUS,1,Would you desire lime and hair to speak better?
A Midsummer Night's Dream,5,1,DEMETRIUS,1,It is the wittiest partition that ever I heard
A Midsummer Night's Dream,5,1,DEMETRIUS,2,"discourse, my lord."
A Midsummer Night's Dream,5,1,THESEUS,1,Pyramus draws near the wall: silence!
A Midsummer Night's Dream,5,1,PYRAMUS,1,O grim-look'd night! O night with hue so black!
A Midsummer Night's Dream,5,1,PYRAMUS,2,"O night, which ever art when day is not!"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,5,1,PYRAMUS,3,"O night, O night! alack, alack, alack,"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,5,1,PYRAMUS,4,I fear my Thisby's promise is forgot!
A Midsummer Night's Dream,5,1,PYRAMUS,5,"And thou, O wall, O sweet, O lovely wall,"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,5,1,PYRAMUS,6,That stand'st between her father's ground and mine!
A Midsummer Night's Dream,5,1,PYRAMUS,7,"Thou wall, O wall, O sweet and lovely wall,"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,5,1,PYRAMUS,8,"Show me thy chink, to blink through with mine eyne!"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,5,1,PYRAMUS,9,"Thanks, courteous wall: Jove shield thee well for this!"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,5,1,PYRAMUS,10,But what see I? No Thisby do I see.
A Midsummer Night's Dream,5,1,PYRAMUS,11,"O wicked wall, through whom I see no bliss!"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,5,1,PYRAMUS,12,Cursed be thy stones for thus deceiving me!
A Midsummer Night's Dream,5,1,THESEUS,1,"The wall, methinks, being sensible, should curse again."
A Midsummer Night's Dream,5,1,PYRAMUS,1,"No, in truth, sir, he should not. 'Deceiving me'"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,5,1,PYRAMUS,2,"is Thisby's cue: she is to enter now, and I am to"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,5,1,PYRAMUS,3,"spy her through the wall. You shall see, it will"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,5,1,PYRAMUS,4,fall pat as I told you. Yonder she comes.
A Midsummer Night's Dream,5,1,THISBE,1,"O wall, full often hast thou heard my moans,"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,5,1,THISBE,2,For parting my fair Pyramus and me!
A Midsummer Night's Dream,5,1,THISBE,3,"My cherry lips have often kiss'd thy stones,"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,5,1,THISBE,4,Thy stones with lime and hair knit up in thee.
A Midsummer Night's Dream,5,1,PYRAMUS,1,"I see a voice: now will I to the chink,"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,5,1,PYRAMUS,2,To spy an I can hear my Thisby's face. Thisby!
A Midsummer Night's Dream,5,1,THISBE,1,"My love thou art, my love I think."
A Midsummer Night's Dream,5,1,PYRAMUS,1,"Think what thou wilt, I am thy lover's grace;"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,5,1,PYRAMUS,2,"And, like Limander, am I trusty still."
A Midsummer Night's Dream,5,1,THISBE,1,"And I like Helen, till the Fates me kill."
A Midsummer Night's Dream,5,1,PYRAMUS,1,Not Shafalus to Procrus was so true.
A Midsummer Night's Dream,5,1,THISBE,1,"As Shafalus to Procrus, I to you."
A Midsummer Night's Dream,5,1,PYRAMUS,1,O kiss me through the hole of this vile wall!
A Midsummer Night's Dream,5,1,THISBE,1,"I kiss the wall's hole, not your lips at all."
A Midsummer Night's Dream,5,1,PYRAMUS,1,Wilt thou at Ninny's tomb meet me straightway?
A Midsummer Night's Dream,5,1,THISBE,1,"'Tide life, 'tide death, I come without delay."
A Midsummer Night's Dream,5,1,WALL,1,"Thus have I, Wall, my part discharged so;"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,5,1,WALL,2,"And, being done, thus Wall away doth go."
A Midsummer Night's Dream,5,1,THESEUS,1,Now is the mural down between the two neighbours.
A Midsummer Night's Dream,5,1,DEMETRIUS,1,"No remedy, my lord, when walls are so wilful to hear"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,5,1,DEMETRIUS,2,without warning.
A Midsummer Night's Dream,5,1,HIPPOLYTA,1,This is the silliest stuff that ever I heard.
A Midsummer Night's Dream,5,1,THESEUS,1,The best in this kind are but shadows; and the worst
A Midsummer Night's Dream,5,1,THESEUS,2,"are no worse, if imagination amend them."
A Midsummer Night's Dream,5,1,HIPPOLYTA,1,"It must be your imagination then, and not theirs."
A Midsummer Night's Dream,5,1,THESEUS,1,If we imagine no worse of them than they of
A Midsummer Night's Dream,5,1,THESEUS,2,"themselves, they may pass for excellent men. Here"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,5,1,THESEUS,3,"come two noble beasts in, a man and a lion."
A Midsummer Night's Dream,5,1,LION,1,"You, ladies, you, whose gentle hearts do fear"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,5,1,LION,2,"The smallest monstrous mouse that creeps on floor,"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,5,1,LION,3,"May now perchance both quake and tremble here,"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,5,1,LION,4,When lion rough in wildest rage doth roar.
A Midsummer Night's Dream,5,1,LION,5,"Then know that I, one Snug the joiner, am"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,5,1,LION,6,"A lion-fell, nor else no lion's dam;"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,5,1,LION,7,"For, if I should as lion come in strife"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,5,1,LION,8,"Into this place, 'twere pity on my life."
A Midsummer Night's Dream,5,1,THESEUS,1,"A very gentle beast, of a good conscience."
A Midsummer Night's Dream,5,1,DEMETRIUS,1,"The very best at a beast, my lord, that e'er I saw."
A Midsummer Night's Dream,5,1,LYSANDER,1,This lion is a very fox for his valour.
A Midsummer Night's Dream,5,1,THESEUS,1,True; and a goose for his discretion.
A Midsummer Night's Dream,5,1,DEMETRIUS,1,"Not so, my lord; for his valour cannot carry his"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,5,1,DEMETRIUS,2,discretion; and the fox carries the goose.
A Midsummer Night's Dream,5,1,THESEUS,1,"His discretion, I am sure, cannot carry his valour;"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,5,1,THESEUS,2,for the goose carries not the fox. It is well:
A Midsummer Night's Dream,5,1,THESEUS,3,"leave it to his discretion, and let us listen to the moon."
A Midsummer Night's Dream,5,1,MOONSHINE,1,This lanthorn doth the horned moon present;--
A Midsummer Night's Dream,5,1,DEMETRIUS,1,He should have worn the horns on his head.
A Midsummer Night's Dream,5,1,THESEUS,1,"He is no crescent, and his horns are"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,5,1,THESEUS,2,invisible within the circumference.
A Midsummer Night's Dream,5,1,MOONSHINE,1,This lanthorn doth the horned moon present;
A Midsummer Night's Dream,5,1,MOONSHINE,2,Myself the man i' the moon do seem to be.
A Midsummer Night's Dream,5,1,THESEUS,1,This is the greatest error of all the rest: the man
A Midsummer Night's Dream,5,1,THESEUS,2,should be put into the lanthorn. How is it else the
A Midsummer Night's Dream,5,1,THESEUS,3,man i' the moon?
A Midsummer Night's Dream,5,1,DEMETRIUS,1,"He dares not come there for the candle; for, you"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,5,1,DEMETRIUS,2,"see, it is already in snuff."
A Midsummer Night's Dream,5,1,HIPPOLYTA,1,I am aweary of this moon: would he would change!
A Midsummer Night's Dream,5,1,THESEUS,1,"It appears, by his small light of discretion, that"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,5,1,THESEUS,2,"he is in the wane; but yet, in courtesy, in all"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,5,1,THESEUS,3,"reason, we must stay the time."
A Midsummer Night's Dream,5,1,LYSANDER,1,"Proceed, Moon."
A Midsummer Night's Dream,5,1,MOONSHINE,1,"All that I have to say, is, to tell you that the"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,5,1,MOONSHINE,2,"lanthorn is the moon; I, the man in the moon; this"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,5,1,MOONSHINE,3,"thorn-bush, my thorn-bush; and this dog, my dog."
A Midsummer Night's Dream,5,1,DEMETRIUS,1,"Why, all these should be in the lanthorn; for all"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,5,1,DEMETRIUS,2,"these are in the moon. But, silence! here comes Thisbe."
A Midsummer Night's Dream,5,1,THISBE,1,This is old Ninny's tomb. Where is my love?
A Midsummer Night's Dream,5,1,DEMETRIUS,1,"Well roared, Lion."
A Midsummer Night's Dream,5,1,THESEUS,1,"Well run, Thisbe."
A Midsummer Night's Dream,5,1,HIPPOLYTA,1,"Well shone, Moon. Truly, the moon shines with a"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,5,1,HIPPOLYTA,2,good grace.
A Midsummer Night's Dream,5,1,THESEUS,1,"Well moused, Lion."
A Midsummer Night's Dream,5,1,LYSANDER,1,And so the lion vanished.
A Midsummer Night's Dream,5,1,DEMETRIUS,1,And then came Pyramus.
A Midsummer Night's Dream,5,1,PYRAMUS,1,"Sweet Moon, I thank thee for thy sunny beams;"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,5,1,PYRAMUS,2,"I thank thee, Moon, for shining now so bright;"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,5,1,PYRAMUS,3,"For, by thy gracious, golden, glittering gleams,"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,5,1,PYRAMUS,4,I trust to take of truest Thisby sight.
A Midsummer Night's Dream,5,1,PYRAMUS,5,"But stay, O spite!"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,5,1,PYRAMUS,6,"But mark, poor knight,"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,5,1,PYRAMUS,7,What dreadful dole is here!
A Midsummer Night's Dream,5,1,PYRAMUS,8,"Eyes, do you see?"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,5,1,PYRAMUS,9,How can it be?
A Midsummer Night's Dream,5,1,PYRAMUS,10,O dainty duck! O dear!
A Midsummer Night's Dream,5,1,PYRAMUS,11,"Thy mantle good,"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,5,1,PYRAMUS,12,"What, stain'd with blood!"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,5,1,PYRAMUS,13,"Approach, ye Furies fell!"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,5,1,PYRAMUS,14,"O Fates, come, come,"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,5,1,PYRAMUS,15,Cut thread and thrum;
A Midsummer Night's Dream,5,1,PYRAMUS,16,"Quail, crush, conclude, and quell!"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,5,1,THESEUS,1,"This passion, and the death of a dear friend, would"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,5,1,THESEUS,2,go near to make a man look sad.
A Midsummer Night's Dream,5,1,HIPPOLYTA,1,"Beshrew my heart, but I pity the man."
A Midsummer Night's Dream,5,1,PYRAMUS,1,"O wherefore, Nature, didst thou lions frame?"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,5,1,PYRAMUS,2,Since lion vile hath here deflower'd my dear:
A Midsummer Night's Dream,5,1,PYRAMUS,3,"Which is--no, no--which was the fairest dame"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,5,1,PYRAMUS,4,"That lived, that loved, that liked, that look'd"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,5,1,PYRAMUS,5,with cheer.
A Midsummer Night's Dream,5,1,PYRAMUS,6,"Come, tears, confound;"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,5,1,PYRAMUS,7,"Out, sword, and wound"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,5,1,PYRAMUS,8,The pap of Pyramus;
A Midsummer Night's Dream,5,1,PYRAMUS,9,"Ay, that left pap,"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,5,1,PYRAMUS,10,Where heart doth hop:
A Midsummer Night's Dream,5,1,PYRAMUS,11,"Thus die I, thus, thus, thus."
A Midsummer Night's Dream,5,1,PYRAMUS,12,"Now am I dead,"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,5,1,PYRAMUS,13,Now am I fled;
A Midsummer Night's Dream,5,1,PYRAMUS,14,My soul is in the sky:
A Midsummer Night's Dream,5,1,PYRAMUS,15,"Tongue, lose thy light;"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,5,1,PYRAMUS,16,Moon take thy flight:
A Midsummer Night's Dream,5,1,PYRAMUS,17,"Now die, die, die, die, die."
A Midsummer Night's Dream,5,1,DEMETRIUS,1,"No die, but an ace, for him; for he is but one."
A Midsummer Night's Dream,5,1,LYSANDER,1,"Less than an ace, man; for he is dead; he is nothing."
A Midsummer Night's Dream,5,1,THESEUS,1,"With the help of a surgeon he might yet recover, and"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,5,1,THESEUS,2,prove an ass.
A Midsummer Night's Dream,5,1,HIPPOLYTA,1,How chance Moonshine is gone before Thisbe comes
A Midsummer Night's Dream,5,1,HIPPOLYTA,2,back and finds her lover?
A Midsummer Night's Dream,5,1,THESEUS,1,She will find him by starlight. Here she comes; and
A Midsummer Night's Dream,5,1,THESEUS,2,her passion ends the play.
A Midsummer Night's Dream,5,1,HIPPOLYTA,1,Methinks she should not use a long one for such a
A Midsummer Night's Dream,5,1,HIPPOLYTA,2,Pyramus: I hope she will be brief.
A Midsummer Night's Dream,5,1,DEMETRIUS,1,"A mote will turn the balance, which Pyramus, which"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,5,1,DEMETRIUS,2,"Thisbe, is the better; he for a man, God warrant us;"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,5,1,DEMETRIUS,3,"she for a woman, God bless us."
A Midsummer Night's Dream,5,1,LYSANDER,1,She hath spied him already with those sweet eyes.
A Midsummer Night's Dream,5,1,DEMETRIUS,1,"And thus she means, videlicet:--"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,5,1,THISBE,1,"Asleep, my love?"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,5,1,THISBE,2,"What, dead, my dove?"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,5,1,THISBE,3,"O Pyramus, arise!"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,5,1,THISBE,4,"Speak, speak. Quite dumb?"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,5,1,THISBE,5,"Dead, dead? A tomb"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,5,1,THISBE,6,Must cover thy sweet eyes.
A Midsummer Night's Dream,5,1,THISBE,7,"These My lips,"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,5,1,THISBE,8,"This cherry nose,"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,5,1,THISBE,9,"These yellow cowslip cheeks,"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,5,1,THISBE,10,"Are gone, are gone:"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,5,1,THISBE,11,"Lovers, make moan:"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,5,1,THISBE,12,His eyes were green as leeks.
A Midsummer Night's Dream,5,1,THISBE,13,"O Sisters Three,"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,5,1,THISBE,14,"Come, come to me,"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,5,1,THISBE,15,With hands as pale as milk;
A Midsummer Night's Dream,5,1,THISBE,16,"Lay them in gore,"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,5,1,THISBE,17,Since you have shore
A Midsummer Night's Dream,5,1,THISBE,18,With shears his thread of silk.
A Midsummer Night's Dream,5,1,THISBE,19,"Tongue, not a word:"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,5,1,THISBE,20,"Come, trusty sword;"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,5,1,THISBE,21,"Come, blade, my breast imbrue:"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,5,1,THISBE,22,"And, farewell, friends;"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,5,1,THISBE,23,Thus Thisby ends:
A Midsummer Night's Dream,5,1,THISBE,24,"Adieu, adieu, adieu."
A Midsummer Night's Dream,5,1,THESEUS,1,Moonshine and Lion are left to bury the dead.
A Midsummer Night's Dream,5,1,DEMETRIUS,1,"Ay, and Wall too."
A Midsummer Night's Dream,5,1,BOTTOM,1,parted their fathers. Will it please you to see the
A Midsummer Night's Dream,5,1,BOTTOM,2,"epilogue, or to hear a Bergomask dance between two"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,5,1,BOTTOM,3,of our company?
A Midsummer Night's Dream,5,1,THESEUS,1,"No epilogue, I pray you; for your play needs no"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,5,1,THESEUS,2,excuse. Never excuse; for when the players are all
A Midsummer Night's Dream,5,1,THESEUS,3,"dead, there needs none to be blamed. Marry, if he"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,5,1,THESEUS,4,that writ it had played Pyramus and hanged himself
A Midsummer Night's Dream,5,1,THESEUS,5,"in Thisbe's garter, it would have been a fine"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,5,1,THESEUS,6,"tragedy: and so it is, truly; and very notably"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,5,1,THESEUS,7,"discharged. But come, your Bergomask: let your"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,5,1,THESEUS,8,epilogue alone.
A Midsummer Night's Dream,5,1,THESEUS,9,The iron tongue of midnight hath told twelve:
A Midsummer Night's Dream,5,1,THESEUS,10,"Lovers, to bed; 'tis almost fairy time."
A Midsummer Night's Dream,5,1,THESEUS,11,I fear we shall out-sleep the coming morn
A Midsummer Night's Dream,5,1,THESEUS,12,As much as we this night have overwatch'd.
A Midsummer Night's Dream,5,1,THESEUS,13,This palpable-gross play hath well beguiled
A Midsummer Night's Dream,5,1,THESEUS,14,"The heavy gait of night. Sweet friends, to bed."
A Midsummer Night's Dream,5,1,THESEUS,15,"A fortnight hold we this solemnity,"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,5,1,THESEUS,16,In nightly revels and new jollity.
A Midsummer Night's Dream,5,1,PUCK,1,"Now the hungry lion roars,"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,5,1,PUCK,2,And the wolf behowls the moon;
A Midsummer Night's Dream,5,1,PUCK,3,"Whilst the heavy ploughman snores,"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,5,1,PUCK,4,All with weary task fordone.
A Midsummer Night's Dream,5,1,PUCK,5,"Now the wasted brands do glow,"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,5,1,PUCK,6,"Whilst the screech-owl, screeching loud,"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,5,1,PUCK,7,Puts the wretch that lies in woe
A Midsummer Night's Dream,5,1,PUCK,8,In remembrance of a shroud.
A Midsummer Night's Dream,5,1,PUCK,9,Now it is the time of night
A Midsummer Night's Dream,5,1,PUCK,10,"That the graves all gaping wide,"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,5,1,PUCK,11,"Every one lets forth his sprite,"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,5,1,PUCK,12,In the church-way paths to glide:
A Midsummer Night's Dream,5,1,PUCK,13,"And we fairies, that do run"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,5,1,PUCK,14,"By the triple Hecate's team,"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,5,1,PUCK,15,"From the presence of the sun,"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,5,1,PUCK,16,"Following darkness like a dream,"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,5,1,PUCK,17,Now are frolic: not a mouse
A Midsummer Night's Dream,5,1,PUCK,18,Shall disturb this hallow'd house:
A Midsummer Night's Dream,5,1,PUCK,19,"I am sent with broom before,"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,5,1,PUCK,20,To sweep the dust behind the door.
A Midsummer Night's Dream,5,1,OBERON,1,"Through the house give gathering light,"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,5,1,OBERON,2,By the dead and drowsy fire:
A Midsummer Night's Dream,5,1,OBERON,3,Every elf and fairy sprite
A Midsummer Night's Dream,5,1,OBERON,4,Hop as light as bird from brier;
A Midsummer Night's Dream,5,1,OBERON,5,"And this ditty, after me,"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,5,1,OBERON,6,"Sing, and dance it trippingly."
A Midsummer Night's Dream,5,1,TITANIA,1,"First, rehearse your song by rote"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,5,1,TITANIA,2,To each word a warbling note:
A Midsummer Night's Dream,5,1,TITANIA,3,"Hand in hand, with fairy grace,"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,5,1,TITANIA,4,"Will we sing, and bless this place."
A Midsummer Night's Dream,5,1,OBERON,1,"Now, until the break of day,"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,5,1,OBERON,2,Through this house each fairy stray.
A Midsummer Night's Dream,5,1,OBERON,3,"To the best bride-bed will we,"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,5,1,OBERON,4,Which by us shall blessed be;
A Midsummer Night's Dream,5,1,OBERON,5,And the issue there create
A Midsummer Night's Dream,5,1,OBERON,6,Ever shall be fortunate.
A Midsummer Night's Dream,5,1,OBERON,7,So shall all the couples three
A Midsummer Night's Dream,5,1,OBERON,8,Ever true in loving be;
A Midsummer Night's Dream,5,1,OBERON,9,And the blots of Nature's hand
A Midsummer Night's Dream,5,1,OBERON,10,Shall not in their issue stand;
A Midsummer Night's Dream,5,1,OBERON,11,"Never mole, hare lip, nor scar,"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,5,1,OBERON,12,"Nor mark prodigious, such as are"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,5,1,OBERON,13,"Despised in nativity,"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,5,1,OBERON,14,Shall upon their children be.
A Midsummer Night's Dream,5,1,OBERON,15,"With this field-dew consecrate,"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,5,1,OBERON,16,Every fairy take his gait;
A Midsummer Night's Dream,5,1,OBERON,17,"And each several chamber bless,"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,5,1,OBERON,18,"Through this palace, with sweet peace;"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,5,1,OBERON,19,And the owner of it blest
A Midsummer Night's Dream,5,1,OBERON,20,Ever shall in safety rest.
A Midsummer Night's Dream,5,1,OBERON,21,Trip away; make no stay;
A Midsummer Night's Dream,5,1,OBERON,22,Meet me all by break of day.
A Midsummer Night's Dream,5,1,PUCK,1,"If we shadows have offended,"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,5,1,PUCK,2,"Think but this, and all is mended,"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,5,1,PUCK,3,That you have but slumber'd here
A Midsummer Night's Dream,5,1,PUCK,4,While these visions did appear.
A Midsummer Night's Dream,5,1,PUCK,5,"And this weak and idle theme,"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,5,1,PUCK,6,"No more yielding but a dream,"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,5,1,PUCK,7,"Gentles, do not reprehend:"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,5,1,PUCK,8,"if you pardon, we will mend:"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,5,1,PUCK,9,"And, as I am an honest Puck,"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,5,1,PUCK,10,If we have unearned luck
A Midsummer Night's Dream,5,1,PUCK,11,"Now to 'scape the serpent's tongue,"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,5,1,PUCK,12,We will make amends ere long;
A Midsummer Night's Dream,5,1,PUCK,13,Else the Puck a liar call;
A Midsummer Night's Dream,5,1,PUCK,14,"So, good night unto you all."
A Midsummer Night's Dream,5,1,PUCK,15,"Give me your hands, if we be friends,"
A Midsummer Night's Dream,5,1,PUCK,16,And Robin shall restore amends.
