The Tragedy of Antony and Cleopatra,2,2,MARK ANTONY,8,Out of our question wipe him.
The Tragedy of Antony and Cleopatra,2,2,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,1,You have broken

The Tragedy of Antony and Cleopatra,2,6,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,1,You have done well by water.
The Tragedy of Antony and Cleopatra,2,6,MENAS,1,And you by land.
The Tragedy of Antony and Cleopatra,2,6,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,1,I will praise any man that will praise me; though it
The Tragedy of Antony and Cleopatra,2,6,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,2,cannot be denied what I have done by land.
The Tragedy of Antony and Cleopatra,2,6,MENAS,1,Nor what I have done by water.
The Tragedy of Antony and Cleopatra,2,6,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,1,"Yes, something you can deny for your own"
The Tragedy of Antony and Cleopatra,2,6,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,2,safety: you have been a great thief by sea.
The Tragedy of Antony and Cleopatra,2,6,MENAS,1,And you by land.
The Tragedy of Antony and Cleopatra,2,6,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,1,There I deny my land service. But give me your
The Tragedy of Antony and Cleopatra,2,6,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,2,"hand, Menas: if our eyes had authority, here they"
The Tragedy of Antony and Cleopatra,2,6,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,3,might take two thieves kissing.
The Tragedy of Antony and Cleopatra,2,6,MENAS,1,"All men's faces are true, whatsome'er their hands are."
The Tragedy of Antony and Cleopatra,2,6,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,1,But there is never a fair woman has a true face.
The Tragedy of Antony and Cleopatra,2,6,MENAS,1,No slander; they steal hearts.
The Tragedy of Antony and Cleopatra,2,6,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,1,We came hither to fight with you.
The Tragedy of Antony and Cleopatra,2,6,MENAS,1,"For my part, I am sorry it is turned to a drinking."
The Tragedy of Antony and Cleopatra,2,6,MENAS,2,Pompey doth this day laugh away his fortune.
The Tragedy of Antony and Cleopatra,2,6,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,1,"If he do, sure, he cannot weep't back again."
The Tragedy of Antony and Cleopatra,2,6,MENAS,1,"You've said, sir. We looked not for Mark Antony"
The Tragedy of Antony and Cleopatra,2,6,MENAS,2,"here: pray you, is he married to Cleopatra?"
The Tragedy of Antony and Cleopatra,2,6,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,1,Caesar's sister is called Octavia.
The Tragedy of Antony and Cleopatra,2,6,MENAS,1,"True, sir; she was the wife of Caius Marcellus."
The Tragedy of Antony and Cleopatra,2,6,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,1,But she is now the wife of Marcus Antonius.
The Tragedy of Antony and Cleopatra,2,6,MENAS,1,"Pray ye, sir?"
The Tragedy of Antony and Cleopatra,2,6,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,1,'Tis true.
The Tragedy of Antony and Cleopatra,2,6,MENAS,1,Then is Caesar and he for ever knit together.
The Tragedy of Antony and Cleopatra,2,6,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,1,"If I were bound to divine of this unity, I would"
The Tragedy of Antony and Cleopatra,2,6,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,2,not prophesy so.
The Tragedy of Antony and Cleopatra,2,6,MENAS,1,I think the policy of that purpose made more in the
The Tragedy of Antony and Cleopatra,2,6,MENAS,2,marriage than the love of the parties.
The Tragedy of Antony and Cleopatra,2,6,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,1,"I think so too. But you shall find, the band that"
The Tragedy of Antony and Cleopatra,2,6,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,2,seems to tie their friendship together will be the
The Tragedy of Antony and Cleopatra,2,6,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,3,very strangler of their amity: Octavia is of a
The Tragedy of Antony and Cleopatra,2,6,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,4,"holy, cold, and still conversation."
The Tragedy of Antony and Cleopatra,2,6,MENAS,1,Who would not have his wife so?
The Tragedy of Antony and Cleopatra,2,6,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,1,Not he that himself is not so; which is Mark Antony.
The Tragedy of Antony and Cleopatra,2,6,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,2,He will to his Egyptian dish again: then shall the
The Tragedy of Antony and Cleopatra,2,6,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,3,"sighs of Octavia blow the fire up in Caesar; and, as"
The Tragedy of Antony and Cleopatra,2,6,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,4,"I said before, that which is the strength of their"
The Tragedy of Antony and Cleopatra,2,6,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,5,amity shall prove the immediate author of their
The Tragedy of Antony and Cleopatra,2,6,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,6,variance. Antony will use his affection where it is:
The Tragedy of Antony and Cleopatra,2,6,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,7,he married but his occasion here.
The Tragedy of Antony and Cleopatra,2,6,MENAS,1,"And thus it may be. Come, sir, will you aboard?"
The Tragedy of Antony and Cleopatra,2,6,MENAS,2,I have a health for you.
The Tragedy of Antony and Cleopatra,2,6,DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS,1,"I shall take it, sir: we have used our throats in Egypt."
The Tragedy of Antony and Cleopatra,2,6,MENAS,1,"Come, let's away."
The Tragedy of Antony and Cleopatra,2,7,FIRST SERVANT,1,"Here they'll be, man. Some o' their plants are"

The Tragedy of Antony and Cleopatra,2,7,SECOND SERVANT,2,fellowship: I had as lief have a reed that will do

The Tragedy of Antony and Cleopatra,2,7,FIRST SERVANT,1,"To be called into a huge sphere, and not to be seen"

The Tragedy of Antony and Cleopatra,5,1,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,3,How honourable and how kindly we

The Tragedy of Antony and Cleopatra,5,1,EGYPTIAN,1,So the gods preserve thee!
The Tragedy of Antony and Cleopatra,5,1,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,1,"Come hither, Proculeius. Go and say,"

The Tragedy of Antony and Cleopatra,5,1,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,3,Go with me to my tent; where you shall see

The Tragedy of Antony and Cleopatra,5,2,GALLUS,1,You see how easily she may be surprised:
The Tragedy of Antony and Cleopatra,5,2,GALLUS,2,Guard her till Caesar come.
The Tragedy of Antony and Cleopatra,5,2,IRAS,1,Royal queen!
The Tragedy of Antony and Cleopatra,5,2,CHARMIAN,1,"O Cleopatra! thou art taken, queen:"
The Tragedy of Antony and Cleopatra,5,2,CLEOPATRA,1,"Quick, quick, good hands."

The Tragedy of Antony and Cleopatra,5,2,CLEOPATRA,6,Nor once be chastised with the sober eye
The Tragedy of Antony and Cleopatra,5,2,CLEOPATRA,7,Of dull Octavia. Shall they hoist me up
The Tragedy of Antony and Cleopatra,5,2,CLEOPATRA,8,And show me to the shouting varletry
The Tragedy of Antony and Cleopatra,5,2,CLEOPATRA,9,Of censuring Rome? Rather a ditch in Egypt
The Tragedy of Antony and Cleopatra,5,2,CLEOPATRA,10,Be gentle grave unto me! rather on Nilus' mud
The Tragedy of Antony and Cleopatra,5,2,CLEOPATRA,11,"Lay me stark naked, and let the water-flies"
The Tragedy of Antony and Cleopatra,5,2,CLEOPATRA,12,Blow me into abhorring! rather make
The Tragedy of Antony and Cleopatra,5,2,CLEOPATRA,13,"My country's high pyramides my gibbet,"
The Tragedy of Antony and Cleopatra,5,2,CLEOPATRA,14,And hang me up in chains!
The Tragedy of Antony and Cleopatra,5,2,PROCULEIUS,1,You do extend
The Tragedy of Antony and Cleopatra,5,2,PROCULEIUS,2,These thoughts of horror further than you shall
The Tragedy of Antony and Cleopatra,5,2,PROCULEIUS,3,Find cause in Caesar.
The Tragedy of Antony and Cleopatra,5,2,DOLABELLA,1,"Proculeius,"
The Tragedy of Antony and Cleopatra,5,2,DOLABELLA,2,"What thou hast done thy master Caesar knows,"
The Tragedy of Antony and Cleopatra,5,2,DOLABELLA,3,"And he hath sent for thee: for the queen,"

The Tragedy of Antony and Cleopatra,5,2,PROCULEIUS,3,"To Caesar I will speak what you shall please,"

The Tragedy of Antony and Cleopatra,5,2,CLEOPATRA,1,"Say, I would die."
The Tragedy of Antony and Cleopatra,5,2,DOLABELLA,1,"Most noble empress, you have heard of me?"
The Tragedy of Antony and Cleopatra,5,2,CLEOPATRA,1,I cannot tell.
The Tragedy of Antony and Cleopatra,5,2,DOLABELLA,1,Assuredly you know me.
The Tragedy of Antony and Cleopatra,5,2,CLEOPATRA,1,"No matter, sir, what I have heard or known."
The Tragedy of Antony and Cleopatra,5,2,CLEOPATRA,2,You laugh when boys or women tell their dreams;
The Tragedy of Antony and Cleopatra,5,2,CLEOPATRA,3,Is't not your trick?
The Tragedy of Antony and Cleopatra,5,2,DOLABELLA,1,"I understand not, madam."
The Tragedy of Antony and Cleopatra,5,2,CLEOPATRA,1,I dream'd there was an Emperor Antony:
The Tragedy of Antony and Cleopatra,5,2,CLEOPATRA,2,"O, such another sleep, that I might see"
The Tragedy of Antony and Cleopatra,5,2,CLEOPATRA,3,But such another man!
The Tragedy of Antony and Cleopatra,5,2,DOLABELLA,1,"If it might please ye,--"
The Tragedy of Antony and Cleopatra,5,2,CLEOPATRA,1,His face was as the heavens; and therein stuck
The Tragedy of Antony and Cleopatra,5,2,CLEOPATRA,2,"A sun and moon, which kept their course,"
The Tragedy of Antony and Cleopatra,5,2,CLEOPATRA,3,and lighted
The Tragedy of Antony and Cleopatra,5,2,CLEOPATRA,4,"The little O, the earth."
The Tragedy of Antony and Cleopatra,5,2,DOLABELLA,1,"Most sovereign creature,--"
The Tragedy of Antony and Cleopatra,5,2,CLEOPATRA,1,His legs bestrid the ocean: his rear'd arm
The Tragedy of Antony and Cleopatra,5,2,CLEOPATRA,2,Crested the world: his voice was propertied
The Tragedy of Antony and Cleopatra,5,2,CLEOPATRA,3,"As all the tuned spheres, and that to friends;"
The Tragedy of Antony and Cleopatra,5,2,CLEOPATRA,4,"But when he meant to quail and shake the orb,"
The Tragedy of Antony and Cleopatra,5,2,CLEOPATRA,5,"He was as rattling thunder. For his bounty,"
The Tragedy of Antony and Cleopatra,5,2,CLEOPATRA,6,There was no winter in't; an autumn 'twas
The Tragedy of Antony and Cleopatra,5,2,CLEOPATRA,7,That grew the more by reaping: his delights
The Tragedy of Antony and Cleopatra,5,2,CLEOPATRA,8,Were dolphin-like; they show'd his back above
The Tragedy of Antony and Cleopatra,5,2,CLEOPATRA,9,The element they lived in: in his livery
The Tragedy of Antony and Cleopatra,5,2,CLEOPATRA,10,Walk'd crowns and crownets; realms and islands were
The Tragedy of Antony and Cleopatra,5,2,CLEOPATRA,11,As plates dropp'd from his pocket.
The Tragedy of Antony and Cleopatra,5,2,DOLABELLA,1,Cleopatra!
The Tragedy of Antony and Cleopatra,5,2,CLEOPATRA,1,"Think you there was, or might be, such a man"
The Tragedy of Antony and Cleopatra,5,2,CLEOPATRA,2,As this I dream'd of?
The Tragedy of Antony and Cleopatra,5,2,DOLABELLA,1,"Gentle madam, no."
The Tragedy of Antony and Cleopatra,5,2,CLEOPATRA,1,"You lie, up to the hearing of the gods."
The Tragedy of Antony and Cleopatra,5,2,CLEOPATRA,2,"But, if there be, or ever were, one such,"
The Tragedy of Antony and Cleopatra,5,2,CLEOPATRA,3,It's past the size of dreaming: nature wants stuff
The Tragedy of Antony and Cleopatra,5,2,CLEOPATRA,4,"To vie strange forms with fancy; yet, to imagine"
The Tragedy of Antony and Cleopatra,5,2,CLEOPATRA,5,"And Antony, were nature's piece 'gainst fancy,"
The Tragedy of Antony and Cleopatra,5,2,CLEOPATRA,6,Condemning shadows quite.
The Tragedy of Antony and Cleopatra,5,2,DOLABELLA,1,"Hear me, good madam."
The Tragedy of Antony and Cleopatra,5,2,DOLABELLA,2,"Your loss is as yourself, great; and you bear it"
The Tragedy of Antony and Cleopatra,5,2,DOLABELLA,3,As answering to the weight: would I might never
The Tragedy of Antony and Cleopatra,5,2,DOLABELLA,4,"O'ertake pursued success, but I do feel,"
The Tragedy of Antony and Cleopatra,5,2,DOLABELLA,5,"By the rebound of yours, a grief that smites"
The Tragedy of Antony and Cleopatra,5,2,DOLABELLA,6,My very heart at root.
The Tragedy of Antony and Cleopatra,5,2,CLEOPATRA,1,"I thank you, sir,"
The Tragedy of Antony and Cleopatra,5,2,CLEOPATRA,2,Know you what Caesar means to do with me?
The Tragedy of Antony and Cleopatra,5,2,DOLABELLA,1,I am loath to tell you what I would you knew.
The Tragedy of Antony and Cleopatra,5,2,CLEOPATRA,1,"Nay, pray you, sir,--"
The Tragedy of Antony and Cleopatra,5,2,DOLABELLA,1,"Though he be honourable,--"
The Tragedy of Antony and Cleopatra,5,2,CLEOPATRA,1,"He'll lead me, then, in triumph?"
The Tragedy of Antony and Cleopatra,5,2,DOLABELLA,1,"Madam, he will; I know't."
The Tragedy of Antony and Cleopatra,5,2,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,1,Which is the Queen of Egypt?
The Tragedy of Antony and Cleopatra,5,2,DOLABELLA,1,"It is the emperor, madam."
The Tragedy of Antony and Cleopatra,5,2,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,1,"Arise, you shall not kneel:"
The Tragedy of Antony and Cleopatra,5,2,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,2,"I pray you, rise; rise, Egypt."
The Tragedy of Antony and Cleopatra,5,2,CLEOPATRA,1,"Sir, the gods"
The Tragedy of Antony and Cleopatra,5,2,CLEOPATRA,2,Will have it thus; my master and my lord
The Tragedy of Antony and Cleopatra,5,2,CLEOPATRA,3,I must obey.
The Tragedy of Antony and Cleopatra,5,2,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,1,Take to you no hard thoughts:
The Tragedy of Antony and Cleopatra,5,2,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,2,"The record of what injuries you did us,"
The Tragedy of Antony and Cleopatra,5,2,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,3,"Though written in our flesh, we shall remember"
The Tragedy of Antony and Cleopatra,5,2,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,4,As things but done by chance.
The Tragedy of Antony and Cleopatra,5,2,CLEOPATRA,1,"Sole sir o' the world,"
The Tragedy of Antony and Cleopatra,5,2,CLEOPATRA,2,I cannot project mine own cause so well
The Tragedy of Antony and Cleopatra,5,2,CLEOPATRA,3,To make it clear; but do confess I have
The Tragedy of Antony and Cleopatra,5,2,CLEOPATRA,4,Been laden with like frailties which before
The Tragedy of Antony and Cleopatra,5,2,CLEOPATRA,5,Have often shamed our sex.
The Tragedy of Antony and Cleopatra,5,2,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,1,"Cleopatra, know,"
The Tragedy of Antony and Cleopatra,5,2,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,2,We will extenuate rather than enforce:
The Tragedy of Antony and Cleopatra,5,2,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,3,"If you apply yourself to our intents,"
The Tragedy of Antony and Cleopatra,5,2,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,4,"Which towards you are most gentle, you shall find"
The Tragedy of Antony and Cleopatra,5,2,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,5,A benefit in this change; but if you seek
The Tragedy of Antony and Cleopatra,5,2,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,6,"To lay on me a cruelty, by taking"
The Tragedy of Antony and Cleopatra,5,2,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,7,"Antony's course, you shall bereave yourself"
The Tragedy of Antony and Cleopatra,5,2,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,8,"Of my good purposes, and put your children"
The Tragedy of Antony and Cleopatra,5,2,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,9,"To that destruction which I'll guard them from,"
The Tragedy of Antony and Cleopatra,5,2,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,10,If thereon you rely. I'll take my leave.
The Tragedy of Antony and Cleopatra,5,2,CLEOPATRA,1,"And may, through all the world: 'tis yours; and we,"
The Tragedy of Antony and Cleopatra,5,2,CLEOPATRA,2,"Your scutcheons and your signs of conquest, shall"
The Tragedy of Antony and Cleopatra,5,2,CLEOPATRA,3,"Hang in what place you please. Here, my good lord."
The Tragedy of Antony and Cleopatra,5,2,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,1,You shall advise me in all for Cleopatra.
The Tragedy of Antony and Cleopatra,5,2,CLEOPATRA,1,"This is the brief of money, plate, and jewels,"
The Tragedy of Antony and Cleopatra,5,2,CLEOPATRA,2,I am possess'd of: 'tis exactly valued;
The Tragedy of Antony and Cleopatra,5,2,CLEOPATRA,3,Not petty things admitted. Where's Seleucus?
The Tragedy of Antony and Cleopatra,5,2,SELEUCUS,1,"Here, madam."
The Tragedy of Antony and Cleopatra,5,2,CLEOPATRA,1,"This is my treasurer: let him speak, my lord,"
The Tragedy of Antony and Cleopatra,5,2,CLEOPATRA,2,"Upon his peril, that I have reserved"
The Tragedy of Antony and Cleopatra,5,2,CLEOPATRA,3,"To myself nothing. Speak the truth, Seleucus."
The Tragedy of Antony and Cleopatra,5,2,SELEUCUS,1,"Madam,"
The Tragedy of Antony and Cleopatra,5,2,SELEUCUS,2,"I had rather seal my lips, than, to my peril,"
The Tragedy of Antony and Cleopatra,5,2,SELEUCUS,3,Speak that which is not.
The Tragedy of Antony and Cleopatra,5,2,CLEOPATRA,1,What have I kept back?
The Tragedy of Antony and Cleopatra,5,2,SELEUCUS,1,Enough to purchase what you have made known.
The Tragedy of Antony and Cleopatra,5,2,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,1,"Nay, blush not, Cleopatra; I approve"
The Tragedy of Antony and Cleopatra,5,2,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,2,Your wisdom in the deed.
The Tragedy of Antony and Cleopatra,5,2,CLEOPATRA,1,"See, Caesar! O, behold,"
The Tragedy of Antony and Cleopatra,5,2,CLEOPATRA,2,How pomp is follow'd! mine will now be yours;
The Tragedy of Antony and Cleopatra,5,2,CLEOPATRA,3,"And, should we shift estates, yours would be mine."
The Tragedy of Antony and Cleopatra,5,2,CLEOPATRA,4,The ingratitude of this Seleucus does
The Tragedy of Antony and Cleopatra,5,2,CLEOPATRA,5,"Even make me wild: O slave, of no more trust"
The Tragedy of Antony and Cleopatra,5,2,CLEOPATRA,6,"Than love that's hired! What, goest thou back? thou shalt"
The Tragedy of Antony and Cleopatra,5,2,CLEOPATRA,7,"Go back, I warrant thee; but I'll catch thine eyes,"
The Tragedy of Antony and Cleopatra,5,2,CLEOPATRA,8,"Though they had wings: slave, soulless villain, dog!"
The Tragedy of Antony and Cleopatra,5,2,CLEOPATRA,9,O rarely base!
The Tragedy of Antony and Cleopatra,5,2,OCTAVIUS CAESAR,1,"Good queen, let us entreat you."
The Tragedy of Antony and Cleopatra,5,2,CLEOPATRA,1,"O Caesar, what a wounding shame is this,"
The Tragedy of Antony and Cleopatra,5,2,CLEOPATRA,2,"That thou, vouchsafing here to visit me,"
The Tragedy of Antony and Cleopatra,5,2,CLEOPATRA,3,Doing the honour of thy lordliness
The Tragedy of Antony and Cleopatra,5,2,CLEOPATRA,4,"To one so meek, that mine own servant should"
The Tragedy of Antony and Cleopatra,5,2,CLEOPATRA,5,Parcel the sum of my disgraces by

The Tragedy of Antony and Cleopatra,5,2,CLEOPATRA,9,"As we greet modern friends withal; and say,"
The Tragedy of Antony and Cleopatra,5,2,CLEOPATRA,10,Some nobler token I have kept apart
The Tragedy of Antony and Cleopatra,5,2,CLEOPATRA,11,"For Livia and Octavia, to induce"
The Tragedy of Antony and Cleopatra,5,2,CLEOPATRA,12,Their mediation; must I be unfolded
The Tragedy of Antony and Cleopatra,5,2,CLEOPATRA,13,With one that I have bred? The gods! it smites me
The Tragedy of Antony and Cleopatra,5,2,CLEOPATRA,14,Beneath the fall I have.
The Tragedy of Antony and Cleopatra,5,2,CLEOPATRA,15,"Prithee, go hence;"
The Tragedy of Antony and Cleopatra,5,2,CLEOPATRA,16,Or I shall show the cinders of my spirits
The Tragedy of Antony and Cleopatra,5,2,CLEOPATRA,17,"Through the ashes of my chance: wert thou a man,"

The Tragedy of Antony and Cleopatra,5,2,CLEOPATRA,2,"Hast thou the pretty worm of Nilus there,"
The Tragedy of Antony and Cleopatra,5,2,CLEOPATRA,3,That kills and pains not?
The Tragedy of Antony and Cleopatra,5,2,CLOWN,1,"Truly, I have him: but I would not be the party"
The Tragedy of Antony and Cleopatra,5,2,CLOWN,2,"that should desire you to touch him, for his biting"
The Tragedy of Antony and Cleopatra,5,2,CLOWN,3,is immortal; those that do die of it do seldom or

The Tragedy of Antony and Cleopatra,5,2,CLOWN,1,"Very many, men and women too. I heard of one of"

The Tragedy of Antony and Cleopatra,5,2,CLOWN,1,"Very good. Give it nothing, I pray you, for it is"

The Tragedy of Antony and Cleopatra,5,2,CLEOPATRA,1,Will it eat me?
The Tragedy of Antony and Cleopatra,5,2,CLOWN,1,You must not think I am so simple but I know the
The Tragedy of Antony and Cleopatra,5,2,CLOWN,2,devil himself will not eat a woman: I know that a

The Tragedy of Antony and Cleopatra,5,2,CLEOPATRA,1,"Well, get thee gone; farewell."
The Tragedy of Antony and Cleopatra,5,2,CLOWN,1,"Yes, forsooth: I wish you joy o' the worm."
