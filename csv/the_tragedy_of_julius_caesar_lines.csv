The Tragedy of Julius Caesar,1,2,CAESAR,17,And tell me truly what thou think'st of him.
The Tragedy of Julius Caesar,1,2,CASCA,1,You pull'd me by the cloak; would you speak with me?
The Tragedy of Julius Caesar,1,2,BRUTUS,1,"Ay, Casca; tell us what hath chanced to-day,"
The Tragedy of Julius Caesar,1,2,BRUTUS,2,That Caesar looks so sad.
The Tragedy of Julius Caesar,1,2,CASCA,1,"Why, you were with him, were you not?"
The Tragedy of Julius Caesar,1,2,BRUTUS,1,I should not then ask Casca what had chanced.
The Tragedy of Julius Caesar,1,2,CASCA,1,"Why, there was a crown offered him: and being"
The Tragedy of Julius Caesar,1,2,CASCA,2,"offered him, he put it by with the back of his hand,"
The Tragedy of Julius Caesar,1,2,CASCA,3,thus; and then the people fell a-shouting.
The Tragedy of Julius Caesar,1,2,BRUTUS,1,What was the second noise for?
The Tragedy of Julius Caesar,1,2,CASCA,1,"Why, for that too."
The Tragedy of Julius Caesar,1,2,CASSIUS,1,They shouted thrice: what was the last cry for?
The Tragedy of Julius Caesar,1,2,CASCA,1,"Why, for that too."
The Tragedy of Julius Caesar,1,2,BRUTUS,1,Was the crown offered him thrice?
The Tragedy of Julius Caesar,1,2,CASCA,1,"Ay, marry, was't, and he put it by thrice, every"
The Tragedy of Julius Caesar,1,2,CASCA,2,"time gentler than other, and at every putting-by"
The Tragedy of Julius Caesar,1,2,CASCA,3,mine honest neighbours shouted.
The Tragedy of Julius Caesar,1,2,CASSIUS,1,Who offered him the crown?
The Tragedy of Julius Caesar,1,2,CASCA,1,"Why, Antony."
The Tragedy of Julius Caesar,1,2,BRUTUS,1,"Tell us the manner of it, gentle Casca."
The Tragedy of Julius Caesar,1,2,CASCA,1,I can as well be hanged as tell the manner of it:
The Tragedy of Julius Caesar,1,2,CASCA,2,it was mere foolery; I did not mark it. I saw Mark
The Tragedy of Julius Caesar,1,2,CASCA,3,Antony offer him a crown;--yet 'twas not a crown
The Tragedy of Julius Caesar,1,2,CASCA,4,"neither, 'twas one of these coronets;--and, as I told"
The Tragedy of Julius Caesar,1,2,CASCA,5,"you, he put it by once: but, for all that, to my"
The Tragedy of Julius Caesar,1,2,CASCA,6,"thinking, he would fain have had it. Then he"
The Tragedy of Julius Caesar,1,2,CASCA,7,offered it to him again; then he put it by again:
The Tragedy of Julius Caesar,1,2,CASCA,8,"but, to my thinking, he was very loath to lay his"
The Tragedy of Julius Caesar,1,2,CASCA,9,fingers off it. And then he offered it the third
The Tragedy of Julius Caesar,1,2,CASCA,10,time; he put it the third time by: and still as he
The Tragedy of Julius Caesar,1,2,CASCA,11,"refused it, the rabblement hooted and clapped their"
The Tragedy of Julius Caesar,1,2,CASCA,12,chapped hands and threw up their sweaty night-caps
The Tragedy of Julius Caesar,1,2,CASCA,13,and uttered such a deal of stinking breath because
The Tragedy of Julius Caesar,1,2,CASCA,14,Caesar refused the crown that it had almost choked
The Tragedy of Julius Caesar,1,2,CASCA,15,Caesar; for he swounded and fell down at it: and
The Tragedy of Julius Caesar,1,2,CASCA,16,"for mine own part, I durst not laugh, for fear of"
The Tragedy of Julius Caesar,1,2,CASCA,17,opening my lips and receiving the bad air.
The Tragedy of Julius Caesar,1,2,CASSIUS,1,"But, soft, I pray you: what, did Caesar swound?"
The Tragedy of Julius Caesar,1,2,CASCA,1,"He fell down in the market-place, and foamed at"
The Tragedy of Julius Caesar,1,2,CASCA,2,"mouth, and was speechless."
The Tragedy of Julius Caesar,1,2,BRUTUS,1,'Tis very like: he hath the failing sickness.
The Tragedy of Julius Caesar,1,2,CASSIUS,1,"No, Caesar hath it not; but you and I,"
The Tragedy of Julius Caesar,1,2,CASSIUS,2,"And honest Casca, we have the falling sickness."
The Tragedy of Julius Caesar,1,2,CASCA,1,"I know not what you mean by that; but, I am sure,"
The Tragedy of Julius Caesar,1,2,CASCA,2,Caesar fell down. If the tag-rag people did not
The Tragedy of Julius Caesar,1,2,CASCA,3,"clap him and hiss him, according as he pleased and"
The Tragedy of Julius Caesar,1,2,CASCA,4,"displeased them, as they use to do the players in"
The Tragedy of Julius Caesar,1,2,CASCA,5,"the theatre, I am no true man."
The Tragedy of Julius Caesar,1,2,BRUTUS,1,What said he when he came unto himself?
The Tragedy of Julius Caesar,1,2,CASCA,1,"Marry, before he fell down, when he perceived the"
The Tragedy of Julius Caesar,1,2,CASCA,2,"common herd was glad he refused the crown, he"
The Tragedy of Julius Caesar,1,2,CASCA,3,plucked me ope his doublet and offered them his
The Tragedy of Julius Caesar,1,2,CASCA,4,throat to cut. An I had been a man of any
The Tragedy of Julius Caesar,1,2,CASCA,5,"occupation, if I would not have taken him at a word,"
The Tragedy of Julius Caesar,1,2,CASCA,6,I would I might go to hell among the rogues. And so
The Tragedy of Julius Caesar,1,2,CASCA,7,"he fell. When he came to himself again, he said,"
The Tragedy of Julius Caesar,1,2,CASCA,8,"If he had done or said any thing amiss, he desired"
The Tragedy of Julius Caesar,1,2,CASCA,9,their worships to think it was his infirmity. Three
The Tragedy of Julius Caesar,1,2,CASCA,10,"or four wenches, where I stood, cried 'Alas, good"
The Tragedy of Julius Caesar,1,2,CASCA,11,soul!' and forgave him with all their hearts: but
The Tragedy of Julius Caesar,1,2,CASCA,12,there's no heed to be taken of them; if Caesar had
The Tragedy of Julius Caesar,1,2,CASCA,13,"stabbed their mothers, they would have done no less."
The Tragedy of Julius Caesar,1,2,BRUTUS,1,"And after that, he came, thus sad, away?"
The Tragedy of Julius Caesar,1,2,CASCA,1,Ay.
The Tragedy of Julius Caesar,1,2,CASSIUS,1,Did Cicero say any thing?
The Tragedy of Julius Caesar,1,2,CASCA,1,"Ay, he spoke Greek."
The Tragedy of Julius Caesar,1,2,CASSIUS,1,To what effect?
The Tragedy of Julius Caesar,1,2,CASCA,1,"Nay, an I tell you that, Ill ne'er look you i' the"
The Tragedy of Julius Caesar,1,2,CASCA,2,face again: but those that understood him smiled at
The Tragedy of Julius Caesar,1,2,CASCA,3,"one another and shook their heads; but, for mine own"
The Tragedy of Julius Caesar,1,2,CASCA,4,"part, it was Greek to me. I could tell you more"
The Tragedy of Julius Caesar,1,2,CASCA,5,"news too: Marullus and Flavius, for pulling scarfs"
The Tragedy of Julius Caesar,1,2,CASCA,6,"off Caesar's images, are put to silence. Fare you"
The Tragedy of Julius Caesar,1,2,CASCA,7,"well. There was more foolery yet, if I could"
The Tragedy of Julius Caesar,1,2,CASCA,8,remember it.
The Tragedy of Julius Caesar,1,2,CASSIUS,1,"Will you sup with me to-night, Casca?"
The Tragedy of Julius Caesar,1,2,CASCA,1,"No, I am promised forth."
The Tragedy of Julius Caesar,1,2,CASSIUS,1,Will you dine with me to-morrow?
The Tragedy of Julius Caesar,1,2,CASCA,1,"Ay, if I be alive and your mind hold and your dinner"
The Tragedy of Julius Caesar,1,2,CASCA,2,worth the eating.
The Tragedy of Julius Caesar,1,2,CASSIUS,1,Good: I will expect you.
The Tragedy of Julius Caesar,1,2,CASCA,1,"Do so. Farewell, both."
The Tragedy of Julius Caesar,1,2,BRUTUS,1,What a blunt fellow is this grown to be!
The Tragedy of Julius Caesar,1,2,BRUTUS,2,He was quick mettle when he went to school.
The Tragedy of Julius Caesar,1,2,CASSIUS,1,So is he now in execution
The Tragedy of Julius Caesar,1,2,CASSIUS,2,"Of any bold or noble enterprise,"
The Tragedy of Julius Caesar,1,2,CASSIUS,3,However he puts on this tardy form.
The Tragedy of Julius Caesar,1,2,CASSIUS,4,"This rudeness is a sauce to his good wit,"
The Tragedy of Julius Caesar,1,2,CASSIUS,5,Which gives men stomach to digest his words
The Tragedy of Julius Caesar,1,2,CASSIUS,6,With better appetite.
The Tragedy of Julius Caesar,1,2,BRUTUS,1,And so it is. For this time I will leave you:
The Tragedy of Julius Caesar,1,2,BRUTUS,2,"To-morrow, if you please to speak with me,"
The Tragedy of Julius Caesar,1,2,BRUTUS,3,"I will come home to you; or, if you will,"
The Tragedy of Julius Caesar,1,2,BRUTUS,4,"Come home to me, and I will wait for you."
The Tragedy of Julius Caesar,1,2,CASSIUS,1,"I will do so: till then, think of the world."
The Tragedy of Julius Caesar,1,2,CASSIUS,2,"Well, Brutus, thou art noble; yet, I see,"

The Tragedy of Julius Caesar,4,3,MESSALA,3,"Had you your letters from your wife, my lord?"
The Tragedy of Julius Caesar,4,3,BRUTUS,1,"No, Messala."
The Tragedy of Julius Caesar,4,3,MESSALA,1,Nor nothing in your letters writ of her?
The Tragedy of Julius Caesar,4,3,BRUTUS,1,"Nothing, Messala."
The Tragedy of Julius Caesar,4,3,MESSALA,1,"That, methinks, is strange."
The Tragedy of Julius Caesar,4,3,BRUTUS,1,Why ask you? hear you aught of her in yours?
The Tragedy of Julius Caesar,4,3,MESSALA,1,"No, my lord."
The Tragedy of Julius Caesar,4,3,BRUTUS,1,"Now, as you are a Roman, tell me true."
The Tragedy of Julius Caesar,4,3,MESSALA,1,Then like a Roman bear the truth I tell:
The Tragedy of Julius Caesar,4,3,MESSALA,2,"For certain she is dead, and by strange manner."
The Tragedy of Julius Caesar,4,3,BRUTUS,1,"Why, farewell, Portia. We must die, Messala:"
The Tragedy of Julius Caesar,4,3,BRUTUS,2,"With meditating that she must die once,"
The Tragedy of Julius Caesar,4,3,BRUTUS,3,I have the patience to endure it now.
The Tragedy of Julius Caesar,4,3,MESSALA,1,Even so great men great losses should endure.
The Tragedy of Julius Caesar,4,3,CASSIUS,1,"I have as much of this in art as you,"
The Tragedy of Julius Caesar,4,3,CASSIUS,2,But yet my nature could not bear it so.
The Tragedy of Julius Caesar,4,3,BRUTUS,1,"Well, to our work alive. What do you think"
The Tragedy of Julius Caesar,4,3,BRUTUS,2,Of marching to Philippi presently?
The Tragedy of Julius Caesar,4,3,CASSIUS,1,I do not think it good.
The Tragedy of Julius Caesar,4,3,BRUTUS,1,Your reason?
The Tragedy of Julius Caesar,4,3,CASSIUS,1,This it is:
The Tragedy of Julius Caesar,4,3,CASSIUS,2,'Tis better that the enemy seek us:
The Tragedy of Julius Caesar,4,3,CASSIUS,3,"So shall he waste his means, weary his soldiers,"
The Tragedy of Julius Caesar,4,3,CASSIUS,4,"Doing himself offence; whilst we, lying still,"
The Tragedy of Julius Caesar,4,3,CASSIUS,5,"Are full of rest, defense, and nimbleness."
The Tragedy of Julius Caesar,4,3,BRUTUS,1,"Good reasons must, of force, give place to better."
The Tragedy of Julius Caesar,4,3,BRUTUS,2,The people 'twixt Philippi and this ground
The Tragedy of Julius Caesar,4,3,BRUTUS,3,Do stand but in a forced affection;
The Tragedy of Julius Caesar,4,3,BRUTUS,4,For they have grudged us contribution:
The Tragedy of Julius Caesar,4,3,BRUTUS,5,"The enemy, marching along by them,"
The Tragedy of Julius Caesar,4,3,BRUTUS,6,"By them shall make a fuller number up,"
The Tragedy of Julius Caesar,4,3,BRUTUS,7,"Come on refresh'd, new-added, and encouraged;"
The Tragedy of Julius Caesar,4,3,BRUTUS,8,"From which advantage shall we cut him off,"
The Tragedy of Julius Caesar,4,3,BRUTUS,9,"If at Philippi we do face him there,"
The Tragedy of Julius Caesar,4,3,BRUTUS,10,These people at our back.
The Tragedy of Julius Caesar,4,3,CASSIUS,1,"Hear me, good brother."
The Tragedy of Julius Caesar,4,3,BRUTUS,1,"Under your pardon. You must note beside,"
The Tragedy of Julius Caesar,4,3,BRUTUS,2,"That we have tried the utmost of our friends,"
The Tragedy of Julius Caesar,4,3,BRUTUS,3,"Our legions are brim-full, our cause is ripe:"
The Tragedy of Julius Caesar,4,3,BRUTUS,4,The enemy increaseth every day;
The Tragedy of Julius Caesar,4,3,BRUTUS,5,"We, at the height, are ready to decline."
The Tragedy of Julius Caesar,4,3,BRUTUS,6,"There is a tide in the affairs of men,"
The Tragedy of Julius Caesar,4,3,BRUTUS,7,"Which, taken at the flood, leads on to fortune;"
The Tragedy of Julius Caesar,4,3,BRUTUS,8,"Omitted, all the voyage of their life"
The Tragedy of Julius Caesar,4,3,BRUTUS,9,Is bound in shallows and in miseries.
The Tragedy of Julius Caesar,4,3,BRUTUS,10,On such a full sea are we now afloat;
The Tragedy of Julius Caesar,4,3,BRUTUS,11,"And we must take the current when it serves,"
The Tragedy of Julius Caesar,4,3,BRUTUS,12,Or lose our ventures.
The Tragedy of Julius Caesar,4,3,CASSIUS,1,"Then, with your will, go on;"
The Tragedy of Julius Caesar,4,3,CASSIUS,2,"We'll along ourselves, and meet them at Philippi."
The Tragedy of Julius Caesar,4,3,BRUTUS,1,"The deep of night is crept upon our talk,"
The Tragedy of Julius Caesar,4,3,BRUTUS,2,And nature must obey necessity;
The Tragedy of Julius Caesar,4,3,BRUTUS,3,Which we will niggard with a little rest.
The Tragedy of Julius Caesar,4,3,BRUTUS,4,There is no more to say?
The Tragedy of Julius Caesar,4,3,CASSIUS,1,No more. Good night:
The Tragedy of Julius Caesar,4,3,CASSIUS,2,"Early to-morrow will we rise, and hence."
The Tragedy of Julius Caesar,4,3,BRUTUS,1,Lucius!
The Tragedy of Julius Caesar,4,3,BRUTUS,2,My gown.
The Tragedy of Julius Caesar,4,3,BRUTUS,3,"Farewell, good Messala:"
The Tragedy of Julius Caesar,4,3,BRUTUS,4,"Good night, Titinius. Noble, noble Cassius,"
The Tragedy of Julius Caesar,4,3,BRUTUS,5,"Good night, and good repose."
The Tragedy of Julius Caesar,4,3,CASSIUS,1,O my dear brother!
The Tragedy of Julius Caesar,4,3,CASSIUS,2,This was an ill beginning of the night:
The Tragedy of Julius Caesar,4,3,CASSIUS,3,Never come such division 'tween our souls!
The Tragedy of Julius Caesar,4,3,CASSIUS,4,"Let it not, Brutus."
The Tragedy of Julius Caesar,4,3,BRUTUS,1,Every thing is well.
The Tragedy of Julius Caesar,4,3,CASSIUS,1,"Good night, my lord."
The Tragedy of Julius Caesar,4,3,BRUTUS,1,"Good night, good brother."
The Tragedy of Julius Caesar,4,3,TITINIUS,1,"Good night, Lord Brutus."
The Tragedy of Julius Caesar,4,3,MESSALA,1,"Good night, Lord Brutus."
The Tragedy of Julius Caesar,4,3,BRUTUS,1,"Farewell, every one."
The Tragedy of Julius Caesar,4,3,BRUTUS,2,Give me the gown. Where is thy instrument?
The Tragedy of Julius Caesar,4,3,LUCIUS,1,Here in the tent.
The Tragedy of Julius Caesar,4,3,BRUTUS,1,"What, thou speak'st drowsily?"
The Tragedy of Julius Caesar,4,3,BRUTUS,2,"Poor knave, I blame thee not; thou art o'er-watch'd."
The Tragedy of Julius Caesar,4,3,BRUTUS,3,Call Claudius and some other of my men:
The Tragedy of Julius Caesar,4,3,BRUTUS,4,I'll have them sleep on cushions in my tent.
The Tragedy of Julius Caesar,4,3,LUCIUS,1,Varro and Claudius!
The Tragedy of Julius Caesar,4,3,VARRO,1,Calls my lord?
The Tragedy of Julius Caesar,4,3,BRUTUS,1,"I pray you, sirs, lie in my tent and sleep;"
The Tragedy of Julius Caesar,4,3,BRUTUS,2,It may be I shall raise you by and by
The Tragedy of Julius Caesar,4,3,BRUTUS,3,On business to my brother Cassius.
The Tragedy of Julius Caesar,4,3,VARRO,1,"So please you, we will stand and watch your pleasure."
The Tragedy of Julius Caesar,4,3,BRUTUS,1,"I will not have it so: lie down, good sirs;"
The Tragedy of Julius Caesar,4,3,BRUTUS,2,It may be I shall otherwise bethink me.
The Tragedy of Julius Caesar,4,3,BRUTUS,3,"Look, Lucius, here's the book I sought for so;"
The Tragedy of Julius Caesar,4,3,BRUTUS,4,I put it in the pocket of my gown.
The Tragedy of Julius Caesar,4,3,LUCIUS,1,I was sure your lordship did not give it me.
The Tragedy of Julius Caesar,4,3,BRUTUS,1,"Bear with me, good boy, I am much forgetful."
The Tragedy of Julius Caesar,4,3,BRUTUS,2,"Canst thou hold up thy heavy eyes awhile,"
The Tragedy of Julius Caesar,4,3,BRUTUS,3,And touch thy instrument a strain or two?
The Tragedy of Julius Caesar,4,3,LUCIUS,1,"Ay, my lord, an't please you."
The Tragedy of Julius Caesar,4,3,BRUTUS,1,"It does, my boy:"
The Tragedy of Julius Caesar,4,3,BRUTUS,2,"I trouble thee too much, but thou art willing."
The Tragedy of Julius Caesar,4,3,LUCIUS,1,"It is my duty, sir."
The Tragedy of Julius Caesar,4,3,BRUTUS,1,I should not urge thy duty past thy might;
The Tragedy of Julius Caesar,4,3,BRUTUS,2,I know young bloods look for a time of rest.
The Tragedy of Julius Caesar,4,3,LUCIUS,1,"I have slept, my lord, already."
The Tragedy of Julius Caesar,4,3,BRUTUS,1,It was well done; and thou shalt sleep again;
The Tragedy of Julius Caesar,4,3,BRUTUS,2,"I will not hold thee long: if I do live,"
The Tragedy of Julius Caesar,4,3,BRUTUS,3,I will be good to thee.
The Tragedy of Julius Caesar,4,3,BRUTUS,4,"This is a sleepy tune. O murderous slumber,"
The Tragedy of Julius Caesar,4,3,BRUTUS,5,"Lay'st thou thy leaden mace upon my boy,"
The Tragedy of Julius Caesar,4,3,BRUTUS,6,"That plays thee music? Gentle knave, good night;"
The Tragedy of Julius Caesar,4,3,BRUTUS,7,I will not do thee so much wrong to wake thee:
The Tragedy of Julius Caesar,4,3,BRUTUS,8,"If thou dost nod, thou break'st thy instrument;"
The Tragedy of Julius Caesar,4,3,BRUTUS,9,"I'll take it from thee; and, good boy, good night."
The Tragedy of Julius Caesar,4,3,BRUTUS,10,"Let me see, let me see; is not the leaf turn'd down"
The Tragedy of Julius Caesar,4,3,BRUTUS,11,"Where I left reading? Here it is, I think."
The Tragedy of Julius Caesar,4,3,BRUTUS,12,How ill this taper burns! Ha! who comes here?
The Tragedy of Julius Caesar,4,3,BRUTUS,13,I think it is the weakness of mine eyes
The Tragedy of Julius Caesar,4,3,BRUTUS,14,That shapes this monstrous apparition.
The Tragedy of Julius Caesar,4,3,BRUTUS,15,It comes upon me. Art thou any thing?
The Tragedy of Julius Caesar,4,3,BRUTUS,16,"Art thou some god, some angel, or some devil,"
The Tragedy of Julius Caesar,4,3,BRUTUS,17,That makest my blood cold and my hair to stare?
The Tragedy of Julius Caesar,4,3,BRUTUS,18,Speak to me what thou art.
The Tragedy of Julius Caesar,4,3,GHOST,1,"Thy evil spirit, Brutus."
The Tragedy of Julius Caesar,4,3,BRUTUS,1,Why comest thou?
The Tragedy of Julius Caesar,4,3,GHOST,1,To tell thee thou shalt see me at Philippi.
The Tragedy of Julius Caesar,4,3,BRUTUS,1,Well; then I shall see thee again?
The Tragedy of Julius Caesar,4,3,GHOST,1,"Ay, at Philippi."
The Tragedy of Julius Caesar,4,3,BRUTUS,1,"Why, I will see thee at Philippi, then."
The Tragedy of Julius Caesar,4,3,BRUTUS,2,Now I have taken heart thou vanishest:
The Tragedy of Julius Caesar,4,3,BRUTUS,3,"Ill spirit, I would hold more talk with thee."
The Tragedy of Julius Caesar,4,3,BRUTUS,4,"Boy, Lucius! Varro! Claudius! Sirs, awake! Claudius!"
The Tragedy of Julius Caesar,4,3,LUCIUS,1,"The strings, my lord, are false."
The Tragedy of Julius Caesar,4,3,BRUTUS,1,He thinks he still is at his instrument.
The Tragedy of Julius Caesar,4,3,BRUTUS,2,"Lucius, awake!"
The Tragedy of Julius Caesar,4,3,LUCIUS,1,My lord?
The Tragedy of Julius Caesar,4,3,BRUTUS,1,"Didst thou dream, Lucius, that thou so criedst out?"
The Tragedy of Julius Caesar,4,3,LUCIUS,1,"My lord, I do not know that I did cry."
The Tragedy of Julius Caesar,4,3,BRUTUS,1,"Yes, that thou didst: didst thou see any thing?"
The Tragedy of Julius Caesar,4,3,LUCIUS,1,"Nothing, my lord."
The Tragedy of Julius Caesar,4,3,BRUTUS,1,"Sleep again, Lucius. Sirrah Claudius!"
The Tragedy of Julius Caesar,4,3,BRUTUS,2,"Fellow thou, awake!"
The Tragedy of Julius Caesar,4,3,VARRO,1,My lord?
The Tragedy of Julius Caesar,4,3,CLAUDIUS,1,My lord?
The Tragedy of Julius Caesar,4,3,BRUTUS,1,"Why did you so cry out, sirs, in your sleep?"
The Tragedy of Julius Caesar,4,3,VARRO,1,"Did we, my lord?"
The Tragedy of Julius Caesar,4,3,CLAUDIUS,1,"Did we, my lord?"
The Tragedy of Julius Caesar,4,3,BRUTUS,1,Ay: saw you any thing?
The Tragedy of Julius Caesar,4,3,VARRO,1,"No, my lord, I saw nothing."
The Tragedy of Julius Caesar,4,3,CLAUDIUS,1,"Nor I, my lord."
The Tragedy of Julius Caesar,4,3,BRUTUS,1,Go and commend me to my brother Cassius;
The Tragedy of Julius Caesar,4,3,BRUTUS,2,"Bid him set on his powers betimes before,"
The Tragedy of Julius Caesar,4,3,BRUTUS,3,And we will follow.
The Tragedy of Julius Caesar,4,3,VARRO,1,"It shall be done, my lord."
The Tragedy of Julius Caesar,4,3,CLAUDIUS,1,"It shall be done, my lord."
The Tragedy of Julius Caesar,5,1,OCTAVIUS,1,"Now, Antony, our hopes are answered:"
The Tragedy of Julius Caesar,5,1,OCTAVIUS,2,"You said the enemy would not come down,"
The Tragedy of Julius Caesar,5,1,OCTAVIUS,3,But keep the hills and upper regions;
The Tragedy of Julius Caesar,5,1,OCTAVIUS,4,It proves not so: their battles are at hand;
The Tragedy of Julius Caesar,5,1,OCTAVIUS,5,"They mean to warn us at Philippi here,"
The Tragedy of Julius Caesar,5,1,OCTAVIUS,6,Answering before we do demand of them.
The Tragedy of Julius Caesar,5,1,ANTONY,1,"Tut, I am in their bosoms, and I know"
The Tragedy of Julius Caesar,5,1,ANTONY,2,Wherefore they do it: they could be content
The Tragedy of Julius Caesar,5,1,ANTONY,3,To visit other places; and come down
The Tragedy of Julius Caesar,5,1,ANTONY,4,"With fearful bravery, thinking by this face"
The Tragedy of Julius Caesar,5,1,ANTONY,5,To fasten in our thoughts that they have courage;
The Tragedy of Julius Caesar,5,1,ANTONY,6,But 'tis not so.
The Tragedy of Julius Caesar,5,1,MESSENGER,1,"Prepare you, generals:"
The Tragedy of Julius Caesar,5,1,MESSENGER,2,The enemy comes on in gallant show;
The Tragedy of Julius Caesar,5,1,MESSENGER,3,"Their bloody sign of battle is hung out,"
The Tragedy of Julius Caesar,5,1,MESSENGER,4,And something to be done immediately.
The Tragedy of Julius Caesar,5,1,ANTONY,1,"Octavius, lead your battle softly on,"
The Tragedy of Julius Caesar,5,1,ANTONY,2,Upon the left hand of the even field.
The Tragedy of Julius Caesar,5,1,OCTAVIUS,1,Upon the right hand I; keep thou the left.
The Tragedy of Julius Caesar,5,1,ANTONY,1,Why do you cross me in this exigent?
The Tragedy of Julius Caesar,5,1,OCTAVIUS,1,I do not cross you; but I will do so.
The Tragedy of Julius Caesar,5,1,BRUTUS,1,"They stand, and would have parley."
The Tragedy of Julius Caesar,5,1,CASSIUS,1,"Stand fast, Titinius: we must out and talk."
The Tragedy of Julius Caesar,5,1,OCTAVIUS,1,"Mark Antony, shall we give sign of battle?"
The Tragedy of Julius Caesar,5,1,ANTONY,1,"No, Caesar, we will answer on their charge."
The Tragedy of Julius Caesar,5,1,ANTONY,2,Make forth; the generals would have some words.
The Tragedy of Julius Caesar,5,1,OCTAVIUS,1,Stir not until the signal.
The Tragedy of Julius Caesar,5,1,BRUTUS,1,"Words before blows: is it so, countrymen?"
The Tragedy of Julius Caesar,5,1,OCTAVIUS,1,"Not that we love words better, as you do."
The Tragedy of Julius Caesar,5,1,BRUTUS,1,"Good words are better than bad strokes, Octavius."
The Tragedy of Julius Caesar,5,1,ANTONY,1,"In your bad strokes, Brutus, you give good words:"
The Tragedy of Julius Caesar,5,1,ANTONY,2,"Witness the hole you made in Caesar's heart,"
The Tragedy of Julius Caesar,5,1,ANTONY,3,"Crying 'Long live! hail, Caesar!'"
The Tragedy of Julius Caesar,5,1,CASSIUS,1,"Antony,"
The Tragedy of Julius Caesar,5,1,CASSIUS,2,The posture of your blows are yet unknown;
The Tragedy of Julius Caesar,5,1,CASSIUS,3,"But for your words, they rob the Hybla bees,"
The Tragedy of Julius Caesar,5,1,CASSIUS,4,And leave them honeyless.
The Tragedy of Julius Caesar,5,1,ANTONY,1,Not stingless too.
The Tragedy of Julius Caesar,5,1,BRUTUS,1,"O, yes, and soundless too;"
The Tragedy of Julius Caesar,5,1,BRUTUS,2,"For you have stol'n their buzzing, Antony,"
The Tragedy of Julius Caesar,5,1,BRUTUS,3,And very wisely threat before you sting.
The Tragedy of Julius Caesar,5,1,ANTONY,1,"Villains, you did not so, when your vile daggers"
The Tragedy of Julius Caesar,5,1,ANTONY,2,Hack'd one another in the sides of Caesar:
The Tragedy of Julius Caesar,5,1,ANTONY,3,"You show'd your teeth like apes, and fawn'd like hounds,"
The Tragedy of Julius Caesar,5,1,ANTONY,4,"And bow'd like bondmen, kissing Caesar's feet;"
The Tragedy of Julius Caesar,5,1,ANTONY,5,"Whilst damned Casca, like a cur, behind"
The Tragedy of Julius Caesar,5,1,ANTONY,6,Struck Caesar on the neck. O you flatterers!
The Tragedy of Julius Caesar,5,1,CASSIUS,1,"Flatterers! Now, Brutus, thank yourself:"
The Tragedy of Julius Caesar,5,1,CASSIUS,2,"This tongue had not offended so to-day,"
The Tragedy of Julius Caesar,5,1,CASSIUS,3,If Cassius might have ruled.
The Tragedy of Julius Caesar,5,1,OCTAVIUS,1,"Come, come, the cause: if arguing make us sweat,"
The Tragedy of Julius Caesar,5,1,OCTAVIUS,2,The proof of it will turn to redder drops. Look;
The Tragedy of Julius Caesar,5,1,OCTAVIUS,3,I draw a sword against conspirators;
The Tragedy of Julius Caesar,5,1,OCTAVIUS,4,When think you that the sword goes up again?
The Tragedy of Julius Caesar,5,1,OCTAVIUS,5,"Never, till Caesar's three and thirty wounds"
The Tragedy of Julius Caesar,5,1,OCTAVIUS,6,Be well avenged; or till another Caesar
The Tragedy of Julius Caesar,5,1,OCTAVIUS,7,Have added slaughter to the sword of traitors.
The Tragedy of Julius Caesar,5,1,BRUTUS,1,"Caesar, thou canst not die by traitors' hands,"
The Tragedy of Julius Caesar,5,1,BRUTUS,2,Unless thou bring'st them with thee.
The Tragedy of Julius Caesar,5,1,OCTAVIUS,1,So I hope;
The Tragedy of Julius Caesar,5,1,OCTAVIUS,2,I was not born to die on Brutus' sword.
The Tragedy of Julius Caesar,5,1,BRUTUS,1,"O, if thou wert the noblest of thy strain,"
The Tragedy of Julius Caesar,5,1,BRUTUS,2,"Young man, thou couldst not die more honourable."
The Tragedy of Julius Caesar,5,1,CASSIUS,1,"A peevish schoolboy, worthless of such honour,"
The Tragedy of Julius Caesar,5,1,CASSIUS,2,Join'd with a masker and a reveller!
The Tragedy of Julius Caesar,5,1,ANTONY,1,Old Cassius still!
The Tragedy of Julius Caesar,5,1,OCTAVIUS,1,"Come, Antony, away!"
The Tragedy of Julius Caesar,5,1,OCTAVIUS,2,"Defiance, traitors, hurl we in your teeth:"

The Tragedy of Julius Caesar,5,1,BRUTUS,1,"Ho, Lucilius! hark, a word with you."
The Tragedy of Julius Caesar,5,1,CASSIUS,1,Messala!
The Tragedy of Julius Caesar,5,1,CASSIUS,1,"Messala,"
The Tragedy of Julius Caesar,5,1,CASSIUS,2,This is my birth-day; as this very day
The Tragedy of Julius Caesar,5,1,CASSIUS,3,"Was Cassius born. Give me thy hand, Messala:"
The Tragedy of Julius Caesar,5,1,CASSIUS,4,"Be thou my witness that against my will,"
The Tragedy of Julius Caesar,5,1,CASSIUS,5,"As Pompey was, am I compell'd to set"
The Tragedy of Julius Caesar,5,1,CASSIUS,6,Upon one battle all our liberties.
The Tragedy of Julius Caesar,5,1,CASSIUS,7,You know that I held Epicurus strong
The Tragedy of Julius Caesar,5,1,CASSIUS,8,"And his opinion: now I change my mind,"
The Tragedy of Julius Caesar,5,1,CASSIUS,9,And partly credit things that do presage.
The Tragedy of Julius Caesar,5,1,CASSIUS,10,"Coming from Sardis, on our former ensign"
The Tragedy of Julius Caesar,5,1,CASSIUS,11,"Two mighty eagles fell, and there they perch'd,"
The Tragedy of Julius Caesar,5,1,CASSIUS,12,Gorging and feeding from our soldiers' hands;
The Tragedy of Julius Caesar,5,1,CASSIUS,13,Who to Philippi here consorted us:
The Tragedy of Julius Caesar,5,1,CASSIUS,14,This morning are they fled away and gone;
The Tragedy of Julius Caesar,5,1,CASSIUS,15,"And in their steads do ravens, crows and kites,"
The Tragedy of Julius Caesar,5,1,CASSIUS,16,"Fly o'er our heads and downward look on us,"
The Tragedy of Julius Caesar,5,1,CASSIUS,17,As we were sickly prey: their shadows seem
The Tragedy of Julius Caesar,5,1,CASSIUS,18,"A canopy most fatal, under which"
The Tragedy of Julius Caesar,5,1,CASSIUS,19,"Our army lies, ready to give up the ghost."
The Tragedy of Julius Caesar,5,1,MESSALA,1,Believe not so.
The Tragedy of Julius Caesar,5,1,CASSIUS,1,I but believe it partly;
The Tragedy of Julius Caesar,5,1,CASSIUS,2,For I am fresh of spirit and resolved
The Tragedy of Julius Caesar,5,1,CASSIUS,3,To meet all perils very constantly.
The Tragedy of Julius Caesar,5,1,BRUTUS,1,"Even so, Lucilius."
The Tragedy of Julius Caesar,5,1,CASSIUS,1,"Now, most noble Brutus,"

The Tragedy of Julius Caesar,5,1,CASSIUS,4,"But since the affairs of men rest still incertain,"
The Tragedy of Julius Caesar,5,1,CASSIUS,5,Let's reason with the worst that may befall.
The Tragedy of Julius Caesar,5,1,CASSIUS,6,"If we do lose this battle, then is this"
The Tragedy of Julius Caesar,5,1,CASSIUS,7,The very last time we shall speak together:
The Tragedy of Julius Caesar,5,1,CASSIUS,8,What are you then determined to do?
The Tragedy of Julius Caesar,5,1,BRUTUS,1,Even by the rule of that philosophy
The Tragedy of Julius Caesar,5,1,BRUTUS,2,By which I did blame Cato for the death
The Tragedy of Julius Caesar,5,1,BRUTUS,3,"Which he did give himself, I know not how,"
The Tragedy of Julius Caesar,5,1,BRUTUS,4,"But I do find it cowardly and vile,"
The Tragedy of Julius Caesar,5,1,BRUTUS,5,"For fear of what might fall, so to prevent"
The Tragedy of Julius Caesar,5,1,BRUTUS,6,The time of life: arming myself with patience
The Tragedy of Julius Caesar,5,1,BRUTUS,7,To stay the providence of some high powers
The Tragedy of Julius Caesar,5,1,BRUTUS,8,That govern us below.
The Tragedy of Julius Caesar,5,1,CASSIUS,1,"Then, if we lose this battle,"
The Tragedy of Julius Caesar,5,1,CASSIUS,2,You are contented to be led in triumph
The Tragedy of Julius Caesar,5,1,CASSIUS,3,Thorough the streets of Rome?
The Tragedy of Julius Caesar,5,1,BRUTUS,1,"No, Cassius, no: think not, thou noble Roman,"
The Tragedy of Julius Caesar,5,1,BRUTUS,2,That ever Brutus will go bound to Rome;
The Tragedy of Julius Caesar,5,1,BRUTUS,3,He bears too great a mind. But this same day
The Tragedy of Julius Caesar,5,1,BRUTUS,4,Must end that work the ides of March begun;
The Tragedy of Julius Caesar,5,1,BRUTUS,5,And whether we shall meet again I know not.
The Tragedy of Julius Caesar,5,1,BRUTUS,6,Therefore our everlasting farewell take:

The Tragedy of Julius Caesar,5,1,BRUTUS,1,"Why, then, lead on. O, that a man might know"
The Tragedy of Julius Caesar,5,1,BRUTUS,2,The end of this day's business ere it come!
The Tragedy of Julius Caesar,5,1,BRUTUS,3,"But it sufficeth that the day will end,"
The Tragedy of Julius Caesar,5,1,BRUTUS,4,"And then the end is known. Come, ho! away!"
The Tragedy of Julius Caesar,5,2,BRUTUS,1,"Ride, ride, Messala, ride, and give these bills"
The Tragedy of Julius Caesar,5,2,BRUTUS,2,Unto the legions on the other side.
The Tragedy of Julius Caesar,5,2,BRUTUS,3,Let them set on at once; for I perceive
The Tragedy of Julius Caesar,5,2,BRUTUS,4,"But cold demeanor in Octavius' wing,"
The Tragedy of Julius Caesar,5,2,BRUTUS,5,And sudden push gives them the overthrow.
The Tragedy of Julius Caesar,5,2,BRUTUS,6,"Ride, ride, Messala: let them all come down."
The Tragedy of Julius Caesar,5,3,CASSIUS,1,"O, look, Titinius, look, the villains fly!"
The Tragedy of Julius Caesar,5,3,CASSIUS,2,Myself have to mine own turn'd enemy:

The Tragedy of Julius Caesar,5,3,CASSIUS,4,"I slew the coward, and did take it from him."
The Tragedy of Julius Caesar,5,3,TITINIUS,1,"O Cassius, Brutus gave the word too early;"

The Tragedy of Julius Caesar,5,3,TITINIUS,3,"Took it too eagerly: his soldiers fell to spoil,"
The Tragedy of Julius Caesar,5,3,TITINIUS,4,Whilst we by Antony are all enclosed.
