The Merchant of Venice,1,1,ANTONIO,1,"In sooth, I know not why I am so sad:"
The Merchant of Venice,1,1,ANTONIO,2,It wearies me; you say it wearies you;
The Merchant of Venice,1,1,ANTONIO,3,"But how I caught it, found it, or came by it,"
The Merchant of Venice,1,1,ANTONIO,4,"What stuff 'tis made of, whereof it is born,"
The Merchant of Venice,1,1,ANTONIO,5,I am to learn;
The Merchant of Venice,1,1,ANTONIO,6,"And such a want-wit sadness makes of me,"
The Merchant of Venice,1,1,ANTONIO,7,That I have much ado to know myself.
The Merchant of Venice,1,1,SALARINO,1,Your mind is tossing on the ocean;
The Merchant of Venice,1,1,SALARINO,2,"There, where your argosies with portly sail,"
The Merchant of Venice,1,1,SALARINO,3,"Like signiors and rich burghers on the flood,"
The Merchant of Venice,1,1,SALARINO,4,"Or, as it were, the pageants of the sea,"
The Merchant of Venice,1,1,SALARINO,5,"Do overpeer the petty traffickers,"
The Merchant of Venice,1,1,SALARINO,6,"That curtsy to them, do them reverence,"
The Merchant of Venice,1,1,SALARINO,7,As they fly by them with their woven wings.
The Merchant of Venice,1,1,SALANIO,1,"Believe me, sir, had I such venture forth,"
The Merchant of Venice,1,1,SALANIO,2,The better part of my affections would
The Merchant of Venice,1,1,SALANIO,3,Be with my hopes abroad. I should be still
The Merchant of Venice,1,1,SALANIO,4,"Plucking the grass, to know where sits the wind,"
The Merchant of Venice,1,1,SALANIO,5,Peering in maps for ports and piers and roads;
The Merchant of Venice,1,1,SALANIO,6,And every object that might make me fear
The Merchant of Venice,1,1,SALANIO,7,"Misfortune to my ventures, out of doubt"
The Merchant of Venice,1,1,SALANIO,8,Would make me sad.
The Merchant of Venice,1,1,SALARINO,1,My wind cooling my broth
The Merchant of Venice,1,1,SALARINO,2,"Would blow me to an ague, when I thought"
The Merchant of Venice,1,1,SALARINO,3,What harm a wind too great at sea might do.
The Merchant of Venice,1,1,SALARINO,4,"I should not see the sandy hour-glass run,"
The Merchant of Venice,1,1,SALARINO,5,"But I should think of shallows and of flats,"
The Merchant of Venice,1,1,SALARINO,6,"And see my wealthy Andrew dock'd in sand,"
The Merchant of Venice,1,1,SALARINO,7,Vailing her high-top lower than her ribs
The Merchant of Venice,1,1,SALARINO,8,To kiss her burial. Should I go to church
The Merchant of Venice,1,1,SALARINO,9,"And see the holy edifice of stone,"
The Merchant of Venice,1,1,SALARINO,10,"And not bethink me straight of dangerous rocks,"
The Merchant of Venice,1,1,SALARINO,11,"Which touching but my gentle vessel's side,"
The Merchant of Venice,1,1,SALARINO,12,"Would scatter all her spices on the stream,"
The Merchant of Venice,1,1,SALARINO,13,"Enrobe the roaring waters with my silks,"
The Merchant of Venice,1,1,SALARINO,14,"And, in a word, but even now worth this,"
The Merchant of Venice,1,1,SALARINO,15,And now worth nothing? Shall I have the thought
The Merchant of Venice,1,1,SALARINO,16,"To think on this, and shall I lack the thought"
The Merchant of Venice,1,1,SALARINO,17,That such a thing bechanced would make me sad?
The Merchant of Venice,1,1,SALARINO,18,"But tell not me; I know, Antonio"
The Merchant of Venice,1,1,SALARINO,19,Is sad to think upon his merchandise.
The Merchant of Venice,1,1,ANTONIO,1,"Believe me, no: I thank my fortune for it,"
The Merchant of Venice,1,1,ANTONIO,2,"My ventures are not in one bottom trusted,"
The Merchant of Venice,1,1,ANTONIO,3,Nor to one place; nor is my whole estate
The Merchant of Venice,1,1,ANTONIO,4,Upon the fortune of this present year:
The Merchant of Venice,1,1,ANTONIO,5,Therefore my merchandise makes me not sad.
The Merchant of Venice,1,1,SALARINO,1,"Why, then you are in love."
The Merchant of Venice,1,1,ANTONIO,1,"Fie, fie!"
The Merchant of Venice,1,1,SALARINO,1,"Not in love neither? Then let us say you are sad,"
The Merchant of Venice,1,1,SALARINO,2,Because you are not merry: and 'twere as easy
The Merchant of Venice,1,1,SALARINO,3,"For you to laugh and leap and say you are merry,"
The Merchant of Venice,1,1,SALARINO,4,"Because you are not sad. Now, by two-headed Janus,"
The Merchant of Venice,1,1,SALARINO,5,Nature hath framed strange fellows in her time:
The Merchant of Venice,1,1,SALARINO,6,Some that will evermore peep through their eyes
The Merchant of Venice,1,1,SALARINO,7,"And laugh like parrots at a bag-piper,"
The Merchant of Venice,1,1,SALARINO,8,And other of such vinegar aspect
The Merchant of Venice,1,1,SALARINO,9,"That they'll not show their teeth in way of smile,"
The Merchant of Venice,1,1,SALARINO,10,Though Nestor swear the jest be laughable.
The Merchant of Venice,1,1,SALANIO,1,"Here comes Bassanio, your most noble kinsman,"
The Merchant of Venice,1,1,SALANIO,2,Gratiano and Lorenzo. Fare ye well:
The Merchant of Venice,1,1,SALANIO,3,We leave you now with better company.
The Merchant of Venice,1,1,SALARINO,1,"I would have stay'd till I had made you merry,"
The Merchant of Venice,1,1,SALARINO,2,If worthier friends had not prevented me.
The Merchant of Venice,1,1,ANTONIO,1,Your worth is very dear in my regard.
The Merchant of Venice,1,1,ANTONIO,2,"I take it, your own business calls on you"
The Merchant of Venice,1,1,ANTONIO,3,And you embrace the occasion to depart.
The Merchant of Venice,1,1,SALARINO,1,"Good morrow, my good lords."
The Merchant of Venice,1,1,BASSANIO,1,"Good signiors both, when shall we laugh? say, when?"
The Merchant of Venice,1,1,BASSANIO,2,You grow exceeding strange: must it be so?
The Merchant of Venice,1,1,SALARINO,1,We'll make our leisures to attend on yours.
The Merchant of Venice,1,1,LORENZO,1,"My Lord Bassanio, since you have found Antonio,"
The Merchant of Venice,1,1,LORENZO,2,"We two will leave you: but at dinner-time,"
The Merchant of Venice,1,1,LORENZO,3,"I pray you, have in mind where we must meet."
The Merchant of Venice,1,1,BASSANIO,1,I will not fail you.
The Merchant of Venice,1,1,GRATIANO,1,"You look not well, Signior Antonio;"
The Merchant of Venice,1,1,GRATIANO,2,You have too much respect upon the world:
The Merchant of Venice,1,1,GRATIANO,3,They lose it that do buy it with much care:
The Merchant of Venice,1,1,GRATIANO,4,"Believe me, you are marvellously changed."
The Merchant of Venice,1,1,ANTONIO,1,"I hold the world but as the world, Gratiano;"
The Merchant of Venice,1,1,ANTONIO,2,"A stage where every man must play a part,"
The Merchant of Venice,1,1,ANTONIO,3,And mine a sad one.
The Merchant of Venice,1,1,GRATIANO,1,Let me play the fool:
The Merchant of Venice,1,1,GRATIANO,2,"With mirth and laughter let old wrinkles come,"
The Merchant of Venice,1,1,GRATIANO,3,And let my liver rather heat with wine
The Merchant of Venice,1,1,GRATIANO,4,Than my heart cool with mortifying groans.
The Merchant of Venice,1,1,GRATIANO,5,"Why should a man, whose blood is warm within,"
The Merchant of Venice,1,1,GRATIANO,6,Sit like his grandsire cut in alabaster?
The Merchant of Venice,1,1,GRATIANO,7,Sleep when he wakes and creep into the jaundice
The Merchant of Venice,1,1,GRATIANO,8,"By being peevish? I tell thee what, Antonio--"
The Merchant of Venice,1,1,GRATIANO,9,"I love thee, and it is my love that speaks--"
The Merchant of Venice,1,1,GRATIANO,10,There are a sort of men whose visages
The Merchant of Venice,1,1,GRATIANO,11,"Do cream and mantle like a standing pond,"
The Merchant of Venice,1,1,GRATIANO,12,"And do a wilful stillness entertain,"
The Merchant of Venice,1,1,GRATIANO,13,With purpose to be dress'd in an opinion
The Merchant of Venice,1,1,GRATIANO,14,"Of wisdom, gravity, profound conceit,"
The Merchant of Venice,1,1,GRATIANO,15,"As who should say 'I am Sir Oracle,"
The Merchant of Venice,1,1,GRATIANO,16,And when I ope my lips let no dog bark!'
The Merchant of Venice,1,1,GRATIANO,17,"O my Antonio, I do know of these"
The Merchant of Venice,1,1,GRATIANO,18,That therefore only are reputed wise
The Merchant of Venice,1,1,GRATIANO,19,"For saying nothing; when, I am very sure,"
The Merchant of Venice,1,1,GRATIANO,20,"If they should speak, would almost damn those ears,"
The Merchant of Venice,1,1,GRATIANO,21,"Which, hearing them, would call their brothers fools."
The Merchant of Venice,1,1,GRATIANO,22,I'll tell thee more of this another time:
The Merchant of Venice,1,1,GRATIANO,23,"But fish not, with this melancholy bait,"
The Merchant of Venice,1,1,GRATIANO,24,"For this fool gudgeon, this opinion."
The Merchant of Venice,1,1,GRATIANO,25,"Come, good Lorenzo. Fare ye well awhile:"
The Merchant of Venice,1,1,GRATIANO,26,I'll end my exhortation after dinner.
The Merchant of Venice,1,1,LORENZO,1,"Well, we will leave you then till dinner-time:"
The Merchant of Venice,1,1,LORENZO,2,"I must be one of these same dumb wise men,"
The Merchant of Venice,1,1,LORENZO,3,For Gratiano never lets me speak.
The Merchant of Venice,1,1,GRATIANO,1,"Well, keep me company but two years moe,"
The Merchant of Venice,1,1,GRATIANO,2,Thou shalt not know the sound of thine own tongue.
The Merchant of Venice,1,1,ANTONIO,1,Farewell: I'll grow a talker for this gear.
The Merchant of Venice,1,1,GRATIANO,1,"Thanks, i' faith, for silence is only commendable"
The Merchant of Venice,1,1,GRATIANO,2,In a neat's tongue dried and a maid not vendible.
The Merchant of Venice,1,1,ANTONIO,1,Is that any thing now?
The Merchant of Venice,1,1,BASSANIO,1,"Gratiano speaks an infinite deal of nothing, more"
The Merchant of Venice,1,1,BASSANIO,2,than any man in all Venice. His reasons are as two
The Merchant of Venice,1,1,BASSANIO,3,grains of wheat hid in two bushels of chaff: you
The Merchant of Venice,1,1,BASSANIO,4,"shall seek all day ere you find them, and when you"
The Merchant of Venice,1,1,BASSANIO,5,"have them, they are not worth the search."
The Merchant of Venice,1,1,ANTONIO,1,"Well, tell me now what lady is the same"
The Merchant of Venice,1,1,ANTONIO,2,"To whom you swore a secret pilgrimage,"
The Merchant of Venice,1,1,ANTONIO,3,That you to-day promised to tell me of?
The Merchant of Venice,1,1,BASSANIO,1,"'Tis not unknown to you, Antonio,"
The Merchant of Venice,1,1,BASSANIO,2,"How much I have disabled mine estate,"
The Merchant of Venice,1,1,BASSANIO,3,By something showing a more swelling port
The Merchant of Venice,1,1,BASSANIO,4,Than my faint means would grant continuance:
The Merchant of Venice,1,1,BASSANIO,5,Nor do I now make moan to be abridged
The Merchant of Venice,1,1,BASSANIO,6,From such a noble rate; but my chief care
The Merchant of Venice,1,1,BASSANIO,7,Is to come fairly off from the great debts
The Merchant of Venice,1,1,BASSANIO,8,Wherein my time something too prodigal
The Merchant of Venice,1,1,BASSANIO,9,"Hath left me gaged. To you, Antonio,"
The Merchant of Venice,1,1,BASSANIO,10,"I owe the most, in money and in love,"
The Merchant of Venice,1,1,BASSANIO,11,And from your love I have a warranty
The Merchant of Venice,1,1,BASSANIO,12,To unburden all my plots and purposes
The Merchant of Venice,1,1,BASSANIO,13,How to get clear of all the debts I owe.
The Merchant of Venice,1,1,ANTONIO,1,"I pray you, good Bassanio, let me know it;"
The Merchant of Venice,1,1,ANTONIO,2,"And if it stand, as you yourself still do,"
The Merchant of Venice,1,1,ANTONIO,3,"Within the eye of honour, be assured,"
The Merchant of Venice,1,1,ANTONIO,4,"My purse, my person, my extremest means,"
The Merchant of Venice,1,1,ANTONIO,5,Lie all unlock'd to your occasions.
The Merchant of Venice,1,1,BASSANIO,1,"In my school-days, when I had lost one shaft,"
The Merchant of Venice,1,1,BASSANIO,2,I shot his fellow of the self-same flight
The Merchant of Venice,1,1,BASSANIO,3,"The self-same way with more advised watch,"
The Merchant of Venice,1,1,BASSANIO,4,"To find the other forth, and by adventuring both"
The Merchant of Venice,1,1,BASSANIO,5,"I oft found both: I urge this childhood proof,"
The Merchant of Venice,1,1,BASSANIO,6,Because what follows is pure innocence.
The Merchant of Venice,1,1,BASSANIO,7,"I owe you much, and, like a wilful youth,"
The Merchant of Venice,1,1,BASSANIO,8,That which I owe is lost; but if you please
The Merchant of Venice,1,1,BASSANIO,9,To shoot another arrow that self way
The Merchant of Venice,1,1,BASSANIO,10,"Which you did shoot the first, I do not doubt,"
The Merchant of Venice,1,1,BASSANIO,11,"As I will watch the aim, or to find both"
The Merchant of Venice,1,1,BASSANIO,12,Or bring your latter hazard back again
The Merchant of Venice,1,1,BASSANIO,13,And thankfully rest debtor for the first.
The Merchant of Venice,1,1,ANTONIO,1,"You know me well, and herein spend but time"
The Merchant of Venice,1,1,ANTONIO,2,To wind about my love with circumstance;
The Merchant of Venice,1,1,ANTONIO,3,And out of doubt you do me now more wrong
The Merchant of Venice,1,1,ANTONIO,4,In making question of my uttermost
The Merchant of Venice,1,1,ANTONIO,5,Than if you had made waste of all I have:
The Merchant of Venice,1,1,ANTONIO,6,Then do but say to me what I should do
The Merchant of Venice,1,1,ANTONIO,7,"That in your knowledge may by me be done,"
The Merchant of Venice,1,1,ANTONIO,8,"And I am prest unto it: therefore, speak."
The Merchant of Venice,1,1,BASSANIO,1,In Belmont is a lady richly left;
The Merchant of Venice,1,1,BASSANIO,2,"And she is fair, and, fairer than that word,"
The Merchant of Venice,1,1,BASSANIO,3,Of wondrous virtues: sometimes from her eyes
The Merchant of Venice,1,1,BASSANIO,4,I did receive fair speechless messages:
The Merchant of Venice,1,1,BASSANIO,5,"Her name is Portia, nothing undervalued"
The Merchant of Venice,1,1,BASSANIO,6,"To Cato's daughter, Brutus' Portia:"
The Merchant of Venice,1,1,BASSANIO,7,"Nor is the wide world ignorant of her worth,"
The Merchant of Venice,1,1,BASSANIO,8,For the four winds blow in from every coast
The Merchant of Venice,1,1,BASSANIO,9,"Renowned suitors, and her sunny locks"
The Merchant of Venice,1,1,BASSANIO,10,Hang on her temples like a golden fleece;
The Merchant of Venice,1,1,BASSANIO,11,"Which makes her seat of Belmont Colchos' strand,"
The Merchant of Venice,1,1,BASSANIO,12,And many Jasons come in quest of her.
The Merchant of Venice,1,1,BASSANIO,13,"O my Antonio, had I but the means"
The Merchant of Venice,1,1,BASSANIO,14,"To hold a rival place with one of them,"
The Merchant of Venice,1,1,BASSANIO,15,"I have a mind presages me such thrift,"
The Merchant of Venice,1,1,BASSANIO,16,That I should questionless be fortunate!
The Merchant of Venice,1,1,ANTONIO,1,Thou know'st that all my fortunes are at sea;
The Merchant of Venice,1,1,ANTONIO,2,Neither have I money nor commodity
The Merchant of Venice,1,1,ANTONIO,3,To raise a present sum: therefore go forth;
The Merchant of Venice,1,1,ANTONIO,4,Try what my credit can in Venice do:
The Merchant of Venice,1,1,ANTONIO,5,"That shall be rack'd, even to the uttermost,"
The Merchant of Venice,1,1,ANTONIO,6,"To furnish thee to Belmont, to fair Portia."
The Merchant of Venice,1,1,ANTONIO,7,"Go, presently inquire, and so will I,"
The Merchant of Venice,1,1,ANTONIO,8,"Where money is, and I no question make"
The Merchant of Venice,1,1,ANTONIO,9,To have it of my trust or for my sake.
The Merchant of Venice,1,2,PORTIA,1,"By my troth, Nerissa, my little body is aweary of"
The Merchant of Venice,1,2,PORTIA,2,this great world.
The Merchant of Venice,1,2,NERISSA,1,"You would be, sweet madam, if your miseries were in"
The Merchant of Venice,1,2,NERISSA,2,the same abundance as your good fortunes are: and
The Merchant of Venice,1,2,NERISSA,3,"yet, for aught I see, they are as sick that surfeit"
The Merchant of Venice,1,2,NERISSA,4,with too much as they that starve with nothing. It
The Merchant of Venice,1,2,NERISSA,5,"is no mean happiness therefore, to be seated in the"
The Merchant of Venice,1,2,NERISSA,6,"mean: superfluity comes sooner by white hairs, but"
The Merchant of Venice,1,2,NERISSA,7,competency lives longer.
The Merchant of Venice,1,2,PORTIA,1,Good sentences and well pronounced.
The Merchant of Venice,1,2,NERISSA,1,"They would be better, if well followed."
The Merchant of Venice,1,2,PORTIA,1,If to do were as easy as to know what were good to
The Merchant of Venice,1,2,PORTIA,2,"do, chapels had been churches and poor men's"
The Merchant of Venice,1,2,PORTIA,3,cottages princes' palaces. It is a good divine that
The Merchant of Venice,1,2,PORTIA,4,follows his own instructions: I can easier teach
The Merchant of Venice,1,2,PORTIA,5,"twenty what were good to be done, than be one of the"
The Merchant of Venice,1,2,PORTIA,6,twenty to follow mine own teaching. The brain may
The Merchant of Venice,1,2,PORTIA,7,"devise laws for the blood, but a hot temper leaps"
The Merchant of Venice,1,2,PORTIA,8,o'er a cold decree: such a hare is madness the
The Merchant of Venice,1,2,PORTIA,9,"youth, to skip o'er the meshes of good counsel the"
The Merchant of Venice,1,2,PORTIA,10,cripple. But this reasoning is not in the fashion to
The Merchant of Venice,1,2,PORTIA,11,"choose me a husband. O me, the word 'choose!' I may"
The Merchant of Venice,1,2,PORTIA,12,neither choose whom I would nor refuse whom I
The Merchant of Venice,1,2,PORTIA,13,dislike; so is the will of a living daughter curbed
The Merchant of Venice,1,2,PORTIA,14,"by the will of a dead father. Is it not hard,"
The Merchant of Venice,1,2,PORTIA,15,"Nerissa, that I cannot choose one nor refuse none?"
The Merchant of Venice,1,2,NERISSA,1,Your father was ever virtuous; and holy men at their
The Merchant of Venice,1,2,NERISSA,2,"death have good inspirations: therefore the lottery,"
The Merchant of Venice,1,2,NERISSA,3,"that he hath devised in these three chests of gold,"
The Merchant of Venice,1,2,NERISSA,4,"silver and lead, whereof who chooses his meaning"
The Merchant of Venice,1,2,NERISSA,5,"chooses you, will, no doubt, never be chosen by any"
The Merchant of Venice,1,2,NERISSA,6,rightly but one who shall rightly love. But what
The Merchant of Venice,1,2,NERISSA,7,warmth is there in your affection towards any of
The Merchant of Venice,1,2,NERISSA,8,these princely suitors that are already come?
The Merchant of Venice,1,2,PORTIA,1,"I pray thee, over-name them; and as thou namest"
The Merchant of Venice,1,2,PORTIA,2,"them, I will describe them; and, according to my"
The Merchant of Venice,1,2,PORTIA,3,"description, level at my affection."
The Merchant of Venice,1,2,NERISSA,1,"First, there is the Neapolitan prince."
The Merchant of Venice,1,2,PORTIA,1,"Ay, that's a colt indeed, for he doth nothing but"
The Merchant of Venice,1,2,PORTIA,2,talk of his horse; and he makes it a great
The Merchant of Venice,1,2,PORTIA,3,"appropriation to his own good parts, that he can"
The Merchant of Venice,1,2,PORTIA,4,shoe him himself. I am much afeard my lady his
The Merchant of Venice,1,2,PORTIA,5,mother played false with a smith.
The Merchant of Venice,1,2,NERISSA,1,Then there is the County Palatine.
The Merchant of Venice,1,2,PORTIA,1,"He doth nothing but frown, as who should say 'If you"
The Merchant of Venice,1,2,PORTIA,2,"will not have me, choose:' he hears merry tales and"
The Merchant of Venice,1,2,PORTIA,3,smiles not: I fear he will prove the weeping
The Merchant of Venice,1,2,PORTIA,4,"philosopher when he grows old, being so full of"
The Merchant of Venice,1,2,PORTIA,5,unmannerly sadness in his youth. I had rather be
The Merchant of Venice,1,2,PORTIA,6,married to a death's-head with a bone in his mouth
The Merchant of Venice,1,2,PORTIA,7,than to either of these. God defend me from these
The Merchant of Venice,1,2,PORTIA,8,two!
The Merchant of Venice,1,2,NERISSA,1,"How say you by the French lord, Monsieur Le Bon?"
The Merchant of Venice,1,2,PORTIA,1,"God made him, and therefore let him pass for a man."
The Merchant of Venice,1,2,PORTIA,2,"In truth, I know it is a sin to be a mocker: but,"
The Merchant of Venice,1,2,PORTIA,3,"he! why, he hath a horse better than the"
The Merchant of Venice,1,2,PORTIA,4,"Neapolitan's, a better bad habit of frowning than"
The Merchant of Venice,1,2,PORTIA,5,the Count Palatine; he is every man in no man; if a
The Merchant of Venice,1,2,PORTIA,6,"throstle sing, he falls straight a capering: he will"
The Merchant of Venice,1,2,PORTIA,7,"fence with his own shadow: if I should marry him, I"
The Merchant of Venice,1,2,PORTIA,8,should marry twenty husbands. If he would despise me
The Merchant of Venice,1,2,PORTIA,9,"I would forgive him, for if he love me to madness, I"
The Merchant of Venice,1,2,PORTIA,10,shall never requite him.
The Merchant of Venice,1,2,NERISSA,1,"What say you, then, to Falconbridge, the young baron"
The Merchant of Venice,1,2,NERISSA,2,of England?
The Merchant of Venice,1,2,PORTIA,1,"You know I say nothing to him, for he understands"
The Merchant of Venice,1,2,PORTIA,2,"not me, nor I him: he hath neither Latin, French,"
The Merchant of Venice,1,2,PORTIA,3,"nor Italian, and you will come into the court and"
The Merchant of Venice,1,2,PORTIA,4,swear that I have a poor pennyworth in the English.
The Merchant of Venice,1,2,PORTIA,5,"He is a proper man's picture, but, alas, who can"
The Merchant of Venice,1,2,PORTIA,6,converse with a dumb-show? How oddly he is suited!
The Merchant of Venice,1,2,PORTIA,7,"I think he bought his doublet in Italy, his round"
The Merchant of Venice,1,2,PORTIA,8,"hose in France, his bonnet in Germany and his"
The Merchant of Venice,1,2,PORTIA,9,behavior every where.
The Merchant of Venice,1,2,NERISSA,1,"What think you of the Scottish lord, his neighbour?"
The Merchant of Venice,1,2,PORTIA,1,"That he hath a neighbourly charity in him, for he"
The Merchant of Venice,1,2,PORTIA,2,borrowed a box of the ear of the Englishman and
The Merchant of Venice,1,2,PORTIA,3,swore he would pay him again when he was able: I
The Merchant of Venice,1,2,PORTIA,4,think the Frenchman became his surety and sealed
The Merchant of Venice,1,2,PORTIA,5,under for another.
The Merchant of Venice,1,2,NERISSA,1,"How like you the young German, the Duke of Saxony's nephew?"
The Merchant of Venice,1,2,PORTIA,1,"Very vilely in the morning, when he is sober, and"
The Merchant of Venice,1,2,PORTIA,2,"most vilely in the afternoon, when he is drunk: when"
The Merchant of Venice,1,2,PORTIA,3,"he is best, he is a little worse than a man, and"
The Merchant of Venice,1,2,PORTIA,4,"when he is worst, he is little better than a beast:"
The Merchant of Venice,1,2,PORTIA,5,"and the worst fall that ever fell, I hope I shall"
The Merchant of Venice,1,2,PORTIA,6,make shift to go without him.
The Merchant of Venice,1,2,NERISSA,1,"If he should offer to choose, and choose the right"
The Merchant of Venice,1,2,NERISSA,2,"casket, you should refuse to perform your father's"
The Merchant of Venice,1,2,NERISSA,3,"will, if you should refuse to accept him."
The Merchant of Venice,1,2,PORTIA,1,"Therefore, for fear of the worst, I pray thee, set a"
The Merchant of Venice,1,2,PORTIA,2,"deep glass of rhenish wine on the contrary casket,"
The Merchant of Venice,1,2,PORTIA,3,for if the devil be within and that temptation
The Merchant of Venice,1,2,PORTIA,4,"without, I know he will choose it. I will do any"
The Merchant of Venice,1,2,PORTIA,5,"thing, Nerissa, ere I'll be married to a sponge."
The Merchant of Venice,1,2,NERISSA,1,"You need not fear, lady, the having any of these"
The Merchant of Venice,1,2,NERISSA,2,lords: they have acquainted me with their
The Merchant of Venice,1,2,NERISSA,3,"determinations; which is, indeed, to return to their"
The Merchant of Venice,1,2,NERISSA,4,"home and to trouble you with no more suit, unless"
The Merchant of Venice,1,2,NERISSA,5,you may be won by some other sort than your father's
The Merchant of Venice,1,2,NERISSA,6,imposition depending on the caskets.
The Merchant of Venice,1,2,PORTIA,1,"If I live to be as old as Sibylla, I will die as"
The Merchant of Venice,1,2,PORTIA,2,"chaste as Diana, unless I be obtained by the manner"
The Merchant of Venice,1,2,PORTIA,3,of my father's will. I am glad this parcel of wooers
The Merchant of Venice,1,2,PORTIA,4,"are so reasonable, for there is not one among them"
The Merchant of Venice,1,2,PORTIA,5,"but I dote on his very absence, and I pray God grant"
The Merchant of Venice,1,2,PORTIA,6,them a fair departure.
The Merchant of Venice,1,2,NERISSA,1,"Do you not remember, lady, in your father's time, a"
The Merchant of Venice,1,2,NERISSA,2,"Venetian, a scholar and a soldier, that came hither"
The Merchant of Venice,1,2,NERISSA,3,in company of the Marquis of Montferrat?
The Merchant of Venice,1,2,PORTIA,1,"Yes, yes, it was Bassanio; as I think, he was so called."
The Merchant of Venice,1,2,NERISSA,1,"True, madam: he, of all the men that ever my foolish"
The Merchant of Venice,1,2,NERISSA,2,"eyes looked upon, was the best deserving a fair lady."
The Merchant of Venice,1,2,PORTIA,1,"I remember him well, and I remember him worthy of"
The Merchant of Venice,1,2,PORTIA,2,thy praise.
The Merchant of Venice,1,2,PORTIA,3,How now! what news?
The Merchant of Venice,1,2,SERVANT,1,"The four strangers seek for you, madam, to take"
The Merchant of Venice,1,2,SERVANT,2,their leave: and there is a forerunner come from a
The Merchant of Venice,1,2,SERVANT,3,"fifth, the Prince of Morocco, who brings word the"
The Merchant of Venice,1,2,SERVANT,4,prince his master will be here to-night.
The Merchant of Venice,1,2,PORTIA,1,If I could bid the fifth welcome with so good a
The Merchant of Venice,1,2,PORTIA,2,"heart as I can bid the other four farewell, I should"
The Merchant of Venice,1,2,PORTIA,3,be glad of his approach: if he have the condition
The Merchant of Venice,1,2,PORTIA,4,"of a saint and the complexion of a devil, I had"
The Merchant of Venice,1,2,PORTIA,5,"rather he should shrive me than wive me. Come,"
The Merchant of Venice,1,2,PORTIA,6,"Nerissa. Sirrah, go before."
The Merchant of Venice,1,2,PORTIA,7,Whiles we shut the gates
The Merchant of Venice,1,2,PORTIA,8,"upon one wooer, another knocks at the door."
The Merchant of Venice,1,3,SHYLOCK,1,Three thousand ducats; well.
The Merchant of Venice,1,3,BASSANIO,1,"Ay, sir, for three months."
The Merchant of Venice,1,3,SHYLOCK,1,For three months; well.
The Merchant of Venice,1,3,BASSANIO,1,"For the which, as I told you, Antonio shall be bound."
The Merchant of Venice,1,3,SHYLOCK,1,Antonio shall become bound; well.
The Merchant of Venice,1,3,BASSANIO,1,May you stead me? will you pleasure me? shall I
The Merchant of Venice,1,3,BASSANIO,2,know your answer?
The Merchant of Venice,1,3,SHYLOCK,1,Three thousand ducats for three months and Antonio bound.
The Merchant of Venice,1,3,BASSANIO,1,Your answer to that.
The Merchant of Venice,1,3,SHYLOCK,1,Antonio is a good man.
The Merchant of Venice,1,3,BASSANIO,1,Have you heard any imputation to the contrary?
The Merchant of Venice,1,3,SHYLOCK,1,"Oh, no, no, no, no: my meaning in saying he is a"
The Merchant of Venice,1,3,SHYLOCK,2,good man is to have you understand me that he is
The Merchant of Venice,1,3,SHYLOCK,3,sufficient. Yet his means are in supposition: he
The Merchant of Venice,1,3,SHYLOCK,4,"hath an argosy bound to Tripolis, another to the"
The Merchant of Venice,1,3,SHYLOCK,5,"Indies; I understand moreover, upon the Rialto, he"
The Merchant of Venice,1,3,SHYLOCK,6,"hath a third at Mexico, a fourth for England, and"
The Merchant of Venice,1,3,SHYLOCK,7,"other ventures he hath, squandered abroad. But ships"
The Merchant of Venice,1,3,SHYLOCK,8,"are but boards, sailors but men: there be land-rats"
The Merchant of Venice,1,3,SHYLOCK,9,"and water-rats, water-thieves and land-thieves, I"
The Merchant of Venice,1,3,SHYLOCK,10,"mean pirates, and then there is the peril of waters,"
The Merchant of Venice,1,3,SHYLOCK,11,"winds and rocks. The man is, notwithstanding,"
The Merchant of Venice,1,3,SHYLOCK,12,sufficient. Three thousand ducats; I think I may
The Merchant of Venice,1,3,SHYLOCK,13,take his bond.
The Merchant of Venice,1,3,BASSANIO,1,Be assured you may.
The Merchant of Venice,1,3,SHYLOCK,1,"I will be assured I may; and, that I may be assured,"
The Merchant of Venice,1,3,SHYLOCK,2,I will bethink me. May I speak with Antonio?
The Merchant of Venice,1,3,BASSANIO,1,If it please you to dine with us.
The Merchant of Venice,1,3,SHYLOCK,1,"Yes, to smell pork; to eat of the habitation which"
The Merchant of Venice,1,3,SHYLOCK,2,your prophet the Nazarite conjured the devil into. I
The Merchant of Venice,1,3,SHYLOCK,3,"will buy with you, sell with you, talk with you,"
The Merchant of Venice,1,3,SHYLOCK,4,"walk with you, and so following, but I will not eat"
The Merchant of Venice,1,3,SHYLOCK,5,"with you, drink with you, nor pray with you. What"
The Merchant of Venice,1,3,SHYLOCK,6,news on the Rialto? Who is he comes here?
The Merchant of Venice,1,3,BASSANIO,1,This is Signior Antonio.
The Merchant of Venice,1,3,SHYLOCK,1,"I hate him for he is a Christian,"
The Merchant of Venice,1,3,SHYLOCK,2,But more for that in low simplicity
The Merchant of Venice,1,3,SHYLOCK,3,He lends out money gratis and brings down
The Merchant of Venice,1,3,SHYLOCK,4,The rate of usance here with us in Venice.
The Merchant of Venice,1,3,SHYLOCK,5,"If I can catch him once upon the hip,"
The Merchant of Venice,1,3,SHYLOCK,6,I will feed fat the ancient grudge I bear him.
The Merchant of Venice,1,3,SHYLOCK,7,"He hates our sacred nation, and he rails,"
The Merchant of Venice,1,3,SHYLOCK,8,"Even there where merchants most do congregate,"
The Merchant of Venice,1,3,SHYLOCK,9,"On me, my bargains and my well-won thrift,"
The Merchant of Venice,1,3,SHYLOCK,10,"Which he calls interest. Cursed be my tribe,"
The Merchant of Venice,1,3,SHYLOCK,11,If I forgive him!
The Merchant of Venice,1,3,BASSANIO,1,"Shylock, do you hear?"
The Merchant of Venice,1,3,SHYLOCK,1,"I am debating of my present store,"
The Merchant of Venice,1,3,SHYLOCK,2,"And, by the near guess of my memory,"
The Merchant of Venice,1,3,SHYLOCK,3,I cannot instantly raise up the gross
The Merchant of Venice,1,3,SHYLOCK,4,Of full three thousand ducats. What of that?
The Merchant of Venice,1,3,SHYLOCK,5,"Tubal, a wealthy Hebrew of my tribe,"
The Merchant of Venice,1,3,SHYLOCK,6,Will furnish me. But soft! how many months
The Merchant of Venice,1,3,SHYLOCK,7,Do you desire?
The Merchant of Venice,1,3,SHYLOCK,8,"Rest you fair, good signior;"
The Merchant of Venice,1,3,SHYLOCK,9,Your worship was the last man in our mouths.
The Merchant of Venice,1,3,ANTONIO,1,"Shylock, although I neither lend nor borrow"
The Merchant of Venice,1,3,ANTONIO,2,"By taking nor by giving of excess,"
The Merchant of Venice,1,3,ANTONIO,3,"Yet, to supply the ripe wants of my friend,"
The Merchant of Venice,1,3,ANTONIO,4,I'll break a custom. Is he yet possess'd
The Merchant of Venice,1,3,ANTONIO,5,How much ye would?
The Merchant of Venice,1,3,SHYLOCK,1,"Ay, ay, three thousand ducats."
The Merchant of Venice,1,3,ANTONIO,1,And for three months.
The Merchant of Venice,1,3,SHYLOCK,1,I had forgot; three months; you told me so.
The Merchant of Venice,1,3,SHYLOCK,2,"Well then, your bond; and let me see; but hear you;"
The Merchant of Venice,1,3,SHYLOCK,3,Methought you said you neither lend nor borrow
The Merchant of Venice,1,3,SHYLOCK,4,Upon advantage.
The Merchant of Venice,1,3,ANTONIO,1,I do never use it.
The Merchant of Venice,1,3,SHYLOCK,1,When Jacob grazed his uncle Laban's sheep--
The Merchant of Venice,1,3,SHYLOCK,2,"This Jacob from our holy Abram was,"
The Merchant of Venice,1,3,SHYLOCK,3,"As his wise mother wrought in his behalf,"
The Merchant of Venice,1,3,SHYLOCK,4,"The third possessor; ay, he was the third--"
The Merchant of Venice,1,3,ANTONIO,1,And what of him? did he take interest?
The Merchant of Venice,1,3,SHYLOCK,1,"No, not take interest, not, as you would say,"
The Merchant of Venice,1,3,SHYLOCK,2,Directly interest: mark what Jacob did.
The Merchant of Venice,1,3,SHYLOCK,3,When Laban and himself were compromised
The Merchant of Venice,1,3,SHYLOCK,4,That all the eanlings which were streak'd and pied
The Merchant of Venice,1,3,SHYLOCK,5,"Should fall as Jacob's hire, the ewes, being rank,"
The Merchant of Venice,1,3,SHYLOCK,6,"In the end of autumn turned to the rams,"
The Merchant of Venice,1,3,SHYLOCK,7,"And, when the work of generation was"
The Merchant of Venice,1,3,SHYLOCK,8,"Between these woolly breeders in the act,"
The Merchant of Venice,1,3,SHYLOCK,9,"The skilful shepherd peel'd me certain wands,"
The Merchant of Venice,1,3,SHYLOCK,10,"And, in the doing of the deed of kind,"
The Merchant of Venice,1,3,SHYLOCK,11,"He stuck them up before the fulsome ewes,"
The Merchant of Venice,1,3,SHYLOCK,12,Who then conceiving did in eaning time
The Merchant of Venice,1,3,SHYLOCK,13,"Fall parti-colour'd lambs, and those were Jacob's."
The Merchant of Venice,1,3,SHYLOCK,14,"This was a way to thrive, and he was blest:"
The Merchant of Venice,1,3,SHYLOCK,15,"And thrift is blessing, if men steal it not."
The Merchant of Venice,1,3,ANTONIO,1,"This was a venture, sir, that Jacob served for;"
The Merchant of Venice,1,3,ANTONIO,2,"A thing not in his power to bring to pass,"
The Merchant of Venice,1,3,ANTONIO,3,But sway'd and fashion'd by the hand of heaven.
The Merchant of Venice,1,3,ANTONIO,4,Was this inserted to make interest good?
The Merchant of Venice,1,3,ANTONIO,5,Or is your gold and silver ewes and rams?
The Merchant of Venice,1,3,SHYLOCK,1,I cannot tell; I make it breed as fast:
The Merchant of Venice,1,3,SHYLOCK,2,"But note me, signior."
The Merchant of Venice,1,3,ANTONIO,1,"Mark you this, Bassanio,"
The Merchant of Venice,1,3,ANTONIO,2,The devil can cite Scripture for his purpose.
The Merchant of Venice,1,3,ANTONIO,3,An evil soul producing holy witness
The Merchant of Venice,1,3,ANTONIO,4,"Is like a villain with a smiling cheek,"
The Merchant of Venice,1,3,ANTONIO,5,A goodly apple rotten at the heart:
The Merchant of Venice,1,3,ANTONIO,6,"O, what a goodly outside falsehood hath!"
The Merchant of Venice,1,3,SHYLOCK,1,Three thousand ducats; 'tis a good round sum.
The Merchant of Venice,1,3,SHYLOCK,2,"Three months from twelve; then, let me see; the rate--"
The Merchant of Venice,1,3,ANTONIO,1,"Well, Shylock, shall we be beholding to you?"
The Merchant of Venice,1,3,SHYLOCK,1,"Signior Antonio, many a time and oft"
The Merchant of Venice,1,3,SHYLOCK,2,In the Rialto you have rated me
The Merchant of Venice,1,3,SHYLOCK,3,About my moneys and my usances:
The Merchant of Venice,1,3,SHYLOCK,4,"Still have I borne it with a patient shrug,"
The Merchant of Venice,1,3,SHYLOCK,5,For sufferance is the badge of all our tribe.
The Merchant of Venice,1,3,SHYLOCK,6,"You call me misbeliever, cut-throat dog,"
The Merchant of Venice,1,3,SHYLOCK,7,"And spit upon my Jewish gaberdine,"
The Merchant of Venice,1,3,SHYLOCK,8,And all for use of that which is mine own.
The Merchant of Venice,1,3,SHYLOCK,9,"Well then, it now appears you need my help:"
The Merchant of Venice,1,3,SHYLOCK,10,"Go to, then; you come to me, and you say"
The Merchant of Venice,1,3,SHYLOCK,11,"'Shylock, we would have moneys:' you say so;"
The Merchant of Venice,1,3,SHYLOCK,12,"You, that did void your rheum upon my beard"
The Merchant of Venice,1,3,SHYLOCK,13,And foot me as you spurn a stranger cur
The Merchant of Venice,1,3,SHYLOCK,14,Over your threshold: moneys is your suit
The Merchant of Venice,1,3,SHYLOCK,15,What should I say to you? Should I not say
The Merchant of Venice,1,3,SHYLOCK,16,'Hath a dog money? is it possible
The Merchant of Venice,1,3,SHYLOCK,17,A cur can lend three thousand ducats?' Or
The Merchant of Venice,1,3,SHYLOCK,18,"Shall I bend low and in a bondman's key,"
The Merchant of Venice,1,3,SHYLOCK,19,"With bated breath and whispering humbleness, Say this;"
The Merchant of Venice,1,3,SHYLOCK,20,"'Fair sir, you spit on me on Wednesday last;"
The Merchant of Venice,1,3,SHYLOCK,21,You spurn'd me such a day; another time
The Merchant of Venice,1,3,SHYLOCK,22,You call'd me dog; and for these courtesies
The Merchant of Venice,1,3,SHYLOCK,23,I'll lend you thus much moneys'?
The Merchant of Venice,1,3,ANTONIO,1,"I am as like to call thee so again,"
The Merchant of Venice,1,3,ANTONIO,2,"To spit on thee again, to spurn thee too."
The Merchant of Venice,1,3,ANTONIO,3,"If thou wilt lend this money, lend it not"
The Merchant of Venice,1,3,ANTONIO,4,As to thy friends; for when did friendship take
The Merchant of Venice,1,3,ANTONIO,5,A breed for barren metal of his friend?
The Merchant of Venice,1,3,ANTONIO,6,"But lend it rather to thine enemy,"
The Merchant of Venice,1,3,ANTONIO,7,"Who, if he break, thou mayst with better face"
The Merchant of Venice,1,3,ANTONIO,8,Exact the penalty.
The Merchant of Venice,1,3,SHYLOCK,1,"Why, look you, how you storm!"
The Merchant of Venice,1,3,SHYLOCK,2,"I would be friends with you and have your love,"
The Merchant of Venice,1,3,SHYLOCK,3,"Forget the shames that you have stain'd me with,"
The Merchant of Venice,1,3,SHYLOCK,4,Supply your present wants and take no doit
The Merchant of Venice,1,3,SHYLOCK,5,"Of usance for my moneys, and you'll not hear me:"
The Merchant of Venice,1,3,SHYLOCK,6,This is kind I offer.
The Merchant of Venice,1,3,BASSANIO,1,This were kindness.
The Merchant of Venice,1,3,SHYLOCK,1,This kindness will I show.
The Merchant of Venice,1,3,SHYLOCK,2,"Go with me to a notary, seal me there"
The Merchant of Venice,1,3,SHYLOCK,3,"Your single bond; and, in a merry sport,"
The Merchant of Venice,1,3,SHYLOCK,4,"If you repay me not on such a day,"
The Merchant of Venice,1,3,SHYLOCK,5,"In such a place, such sum or sums as are"
The Merchant of Venice,1,3,SHYLOCK,6,"Express'd in the condition, let the forfeit"
The Merchant of Venice,1,3,SHYLOCK,7,Be nominated for an equal pound
The Merchant of Venice,1,3,SHYLOCK,8,"Of your fair flesh, to be cut off and taken"
The Merchant of Venice,1,3,SHYLOCK,9,In what part of your body pleaseth me.
The Merchant of Venice,1,3,ANTONIO,1,"Content, i' faith: I'll seal to such a bond"
The Merchant of Venice,1,3,ANTONIO,2,And say there is much kindness in the Jew.
The Merchant of Venice,1,3,BASSANIO,1,You shall not seal to such a bond for me:
The Merchant of Venice,1,3,BASSANIO,2,I'll rather dwell in my necessity.
The Merchant of Venice,1,3,ANTONIO,1,"Why, fear not, man; I will not forfeit it:"
The Merchant of Venice,1,3,ANTONIO,2,"Within these two months, that's a month before"
The Merchant of Venice,1,3,ANTONIO,3,"This bond expires, I do expect return"
The Merchant of Venice,1,3,ANTONIO,4,Of thrice three times the value of this bond.
The Merchant of Venice,1,3,SHYLOCK,1,"O father Abram, what these Christians are,"
The Merchant of Venice,1,3,SHYLOCK,2,Whose own hard dealings teaches them suspect
The Merchant of Venice,1,3,SHYLOCK,3,"The thoughts of others! Pray you, tell me this;"
The Merchant of Venice,1,3,SHYLOCK,4,"If he should break his day, what should I gain"
The Merchant of Venice,1,3,SHYLOCK,5,By the exaction of the forfeiture?
The Merchant of Venice,1,3,SHYLOCK,6,A pound of man's flesh taken from a man
The Merchant of Venice,1,3,SHYLOCK,7,"Is not so estimable, profitable neither,"
The Merchant of Venice,1,3,SHYLOCK,8,"As flesh of muttons, beefs, or goats. I say,"
The Merchant of Venice,1,3,SHYLOCK,9,"To buy his favour, I extend this friendship:"
The Merchant of Venice,1,3,SHYLOCK,10,"If he will take it, so; if not, adieu;"
The Merchant of Venice,1,3,SHYLOCK,11,"And, for my love, I pray you wrong me not."
The Merchant of Venice,1,3,ANTONIO,1,"Yes Shylock, I will seal unto this bond."
The Merchant of Venice,1,3,SHYLOCK,1,Then meet me forthwith at the notary's;
The Merchant of Venice,1,3,SHYLOCK,2,"Give him direction for this merry bond,"
The Merchant of Venice,1,3,SHYLOCK,3,"And I will go and purse the ducats straight,"
The Merchant of Venice,1,3,SHYLOCK,4,"See to my house, left in the fearful guard"
The Merchant of Venice,1,3,SHYLOCK,5,"Of an unthrifty knave, and presently"
The Merchant of Venice,1,3,SHYLOCK,6,I will be with you.
The Merchant of Venice,1,3,ANTONIO,1,"Hie thee, gentle Jew."
The Merchant of Venice,1,3,ANTONIO,2,The Hebrew will turn Christian: he grows kind.
The Merchant of Venice,1,3,BASSANIO,1,I like not fair terms and a villain's mind.
The Merchant of Venice,1,3,ANTONIO,1,Come on: in this there can be no dismay;
The Merchant of Venice,1,3,ANTONIO,2,My ships come home a month before the day.
The Merchant of Venice,2,1,MOROCCO,1,"Mislike me not for my complexion,"
The Merchant of Venice,2,1,MOROCCO,2,"The shadow'd livery of the burnish'd sun,"
The Merchant of Venice,2,1,MOROCCO,3,To whom I am a neighbour and near bred.
The Merchant of Venice,2,1,MOROCCO,4,"Bring me the fairest creature northward born,"
The Merchant of Venice,2,1,MOROCCO,5,"Where Phoebus' fire scarce thaws the icicles,"
The Merchant of Venice,2,1,MOROCCO,6,"And let us make incision for your love,"
The Merchant of Venice,2,1,MOROCCO,7,"To prove whose blood is reddest, his or mine."
The Merchant of Venice,2,1,MOROCCO,8,"I tell thee, lady, this aspect of mine"
The Merchant of Venice,2,1,MOROCCO,9,Hath fear'd the valiant: by my love I swear
The Merchant of Venice,2,1,MOROCCO,10,The best-regarded virgins of our clime
The Merchant of Venice,2,1,MOROCCO,11,"Have loved it too: I would not change this hue,"
The Merchant of Venice,2,1,MOROCCO,12,"Except to steal your thoughts, my gentle queen."
The Merchant of Venice,2,1,PORTIA,1,In terms of choice I am not solely led
The Merchant of Venice,2,1,PORTIA,2,By nice direction of a maiden's eyes;
The Merchant of Venice,2,1,PORTIA,3,"Besides, the lottery of my destiny"
The Merchant of Venice,2,1,PORTIA,4,Bars me the right of voluntary choosing:
The Merchant of Venice,2,1,PORTIA,5,But if my father had not scanted me
The Merchant of Venice,2,1,PORTIA,6,"And hedged me by his wit, to yield myself"
The Merchant of Venice,2,1,PORTIA,7,"His wife who wins me by that means I told you,"
The Merchant of Venice,2,1,PORTIA,8,"Yourself, renowned prince, then stood as fair"
The Merchant of Venice,2,1,PORTIA,9,As any comer I have look'd on yet
The Merchant of Venice,2,1,PORTIA,10,For my affection.
The Merchant of Venice,2,1,MOROCCO,1,Even for that I thank you:
The Merchant of Venice,2,1,MOROCCO,2,"Therefore, I pray you, lead me to the caskets"
The Merchant of Venice,2,1,MOROCCO,3,To try my fortune. By this scimitar
The Merchant of Venice,2,1,MOROCCO,4,That slew the Sophy and a Persian prince
The Merchant of Venice,2,1,MOROCCO,5,"That won three fields of Sultan Solyman,"
The Merchant of Venice,2,1,MOROCCO,6,"I would outstare the sternest eyes that look,"
The Merchant of Venice,2,1,MOROCCO,7,"Outbrave the heart most daring on the earth,"
The Merchant of Venice,2,1,MOROCCO,8,"Pluck the young sucking cubs from the she-bear,"
The Merchant of Venice,2,1,MOROCCO,9,"Yea, mock the lion when he roars for prey,"
The Merchant of Venice,2,1,MOROCCO,10,"To win thee, lady. But, alas the while!"
The Merchant of Venice,2,1,MOROCCO,11,If Hercules and Lichas play at dice
The Merchant of Venice,2,1,MOROCCO,12,"Which is the better man, the greater throw"
The Merchant of Venice,2,1,MOROCCO,13,May turn by fortune from the weaker hand:
The Merchant of Venice,2,1,MOROCCO,14,So is Alcides beaten by his page;
The Merchant of Venice,2,1,MOROCCO,15,"And so may I, blind fortune leading me,"
The Merchant of Venice,2,1,MOROCCO,16,"Miss that which one unworthier may attain,"
The Merchant of Venice,2,1,MOROCCO,17,And die with grieving.
The Merchant of Venice,2,1,PORTIA,1,"You must take your chance,"
The Merchant of Venice,2,1,PORTIA,2,And either not attempt to choose at all
The Merchant of Venice,2,1,PORTIA,3,"Or swear before you choose, if you choose wrong"
The Merchant of Venice,2,1,PORTIA,4,Never to speak to lady afterward
The Merchant of Venice,2,1,PORTIA,5,In way of marriage: therefore be advised.
The Merchant of Venice,2,1,MOROCCO,1,"Nor will not. Come, bring me unto my chance."
The Merchant of Venice,2,1,PORTIA,1,"First, forward to the temple: after dinner"
The Merchant of Venice,2,1,PORTIA,2,Your hazard shall be made.
The Merchant of Venice,2,1,MOROCCO,1,Good fortune then!
The Merchant of Venice,2,1,MOROCCO,2,To make me blest or cursed'st among men.
The Merchant of Venice,2,2,LAUNCELOT,1,Certainly my conscience will serve me to run from
The Merchant of Venice,2,2,LAUNCELOT,2,this Jew my master. The fiend is at mine elbow and
The Merchant of Venice,2,2,LAUNCELOT,3,"tempts me saying to me 'Gobbo, Launcelot Gobbo, good"
The Merchant of Venice,2,2,LAUNCELOT,4,"Launcelot,' or 'good Gobbo,' or good Launcelot"
The Merchant of Venice,2,2,LAUNCELOT,5,"Gobbo, use your legs, take the start, run away. My"
The Merchant of Venice,2,2,LAUNCELOT,6,"conscience says 'No; take heed,' honest Launcelot;"
The Merchant of Venice,2,2,LAUNCELOT,7,"take heed, honest Gobbo, or, as aforesaid, 'honest"
The Merchant of Venice,2,2,LAUNCELOT,8,Launcelot Gobbo; do not run; scorn running with thy
The Merchant of Venice,2,2,LAUNCELOT,9,"heels.' Well, the most courageous fiend bids me"
The Merchant of Venice,2,2,LAUNCELOT,10,pack: 'Via!' says the fiend; 'away!' says the
The Merchant of Venice,2,2,LAUNCELOT,11,"fiend; 'for the heavens, rouse up a brave mind,'"
The Merchant of Venice,2,2,LAUNCELOT,12,"says the fiend, 'and run.' Well, my conscience,"
The Merchant of Venice,2,2,LAUNCELOT,13,"hanging about the neck of my heart, says very wisely"
The Merchant of Venice,2,2,LAUNCELOT,14,"to me 'My honest friend Launcelot, being an honest"
The Merchant of Venice,2,2,LAUNCELOT,15,"man's son,' or rather an honest woman's son; for,"
The Merchant of Venice,2,2,LAUNCELOT,16,"indeed, my father did something smack, something"
The Merchant of Venice,2,2,LAUNCELOT,17,"grow to, he had a kind of taste; well, my conscience"
The Merchant of Venice,2,2,LAUNCELOT,18,"says 'Launcelot, budge not.' 'Budge,' says the"
The Merchant of Venice,2,2,LAUNCELOT,19,"fiend. 'Budge not,' says my conscience."
The Merchant of Venice,2,2,LAUNCELOT,20,"'Conscience,' say I, 'you counsel well;' ' Fiend,'"
The Merchant of Venice,2,2,LAUNCELOT,21,"say I, 'you counsel well:' to be ruled by my"
The Merchant of Venice,2,2,LAUNCELOT,22,"conscience, I should stay with the Jew my master,"
The Merchant of Venice,2,2,LAUNCELOT,23,"who, God bless the mark, is a kind of devil; and, to"
The Merchant of Venice,2,2,LAUNCELOT,24,"run away from the Jew, I should be ruled by the"
The Merchant of Venice,2,2,LAUNCELOT,25,"fiend, who, saving your reverence, is the devil"
The Merchant of Venice,2,2,LAUNCELOT,26,himself. Certainly the Jew is the very devil
The Merchant of Venice,2,2,LAUNCELOT,27,"incarnal; and, in my conscience, my conscience is"
The Merchant of Venice,2,2,LAUNCELOT,28,"but a kind of hard conscience, to offer to counsel"
The Merchant of Venice,2,2,LAUNCELOT,29,me to stay with the Jew. The fiend gives the more
The Merchant of Venice,2,2,LAUNCELOT,30,"friendly counsel: I will run, fiend; my heels are"
The Merchant of Venice,2,2,LAUNCELOT,31,at your command; I will run.
The Merchant of Venice,2,2,GOBBO,1,"Master young man, you, I pray you, which is the way"
The Merchant of Venice,2,2,GOBBO,2,to master Jew's?
The Merchant of Venice,2,2,LAUNCELOT,1,"who, being more than sand-blind, high-gravel blind,"
The Merchant of Venice,2,2,LAUNCELOT,2,knows me not: I will try confusions with him.
The Merchant of Venice,2,2,GOBBO,1,"Master young gentleman, I pray you, which is the way"
The Merchant of Venice,2,2,GOBBO,2,to master Jew's?
The Merchant of Venice,2,2,LAUNCELOT,1,"Turn up on your right hand at the next turning, but,"
The Merchant of Venice,2,2,LAUNCELOT,2,"at the next turning of all, on your left; marry, at"
The Merchant of Venice,2,2,LAUNCELOT,3,"the very next turning, turn of no hand, but turn"
The Merchant of Venice,2,2,LAUNCELOT,4,down indirectly to the Jew's house.
The Merchant of Venice,2,2,GOBBO,1,"By God's sonties, 'twill be a hard way to hit. Can"
The Merchant of Venice,2,2,GOBBO,2,"you tell me whether one Launcelot,"
The Merchant of Venice,2,2,GOBBO,3,"that dwells with him, dwell with him or no?"
The Merchant of Venice,2,2,LAUNCELOT,1,Talk you of young Master Launcelot?
The Merchant of Venice,2,2,LAUNCELOT,2,Mark me now; now will I raise the waters. Talk you
The Merchant of Venice,2,2,LAUNCELOT,3,of young Master Launcelot?
The Merchant of Venice,2,2,GOBBO,1,"No master, sir, but a poor man's son: his father,"
The Merchant of Venice,2,2,GOBBO,2,"though I say it, is an honest exceeding poor man"
The Merchant of Venice,2,2,GOBBO,3,"and, God be thanked, well to live."
The Merchant of Venice,2,2,LAUNCELOT,1,"Well, let his father be what a' will, we talk of"
The Merchant of Venice,2,2,LAUNCELOT,2,young Master Launcelot.
The Merchant of Venice,2,2,GOBBO,1,"Your worship's friend and Launcelot, sir."
The Merchant of Venice,2,2,LAUNCELOT,1,"But I pray you, ergo, old man, ergo, I beseech you,"
The Merchant of Venice,2,2,LAUNCELOT,2,talk you of young Master Launcelot?
The Merchant of Venice,2,2,GOBBO,1,"Of Launcelot, an't please your mastership."
The Merchant of Venice,2,2,LAUNCELOT,1,"Ergo, Master Launcelot. Talk not of Master"
The Merchant of Venice,2,2,LAUNCELOT,2,"Launcelot, father; for the young gentleman,"
The Merchant of Venice,2,2,LAUNCELOT,3,according to Fates and Destinies and such odd
The Merchant of Venice,2,2,LAUNCELOT,4,"sayings, the Sisters Three and such branches of"
The Merchant of Venice,2,2,LAUNCELOT,5,"learning, is indeed deceased, or, as you would say"
The Merchant of Venice,2,2,LAUNCELOT,6,"in plain terms, gone to heaven."
The Merchant of Venice,2,2,GOBBO,1,"Marry, God forbid! the boy was the very staff of my"
The Merchant of Venice,2,2,GOBBO,2,"age, my very prop."
The Merchant of Venice,2,2,LAUNCELOT,1,"Do I look like a cudgel or a hovel-post, a staff or"
The Merchant of Venice,2,2,LAUNCELOT,2,"a prop? Do you know me, father?"
The Merchant of Venice,2,2,GOBBO,1,"Alack the day, I know you not, young gentleman:"
The Merchant of Venice,2,2,GOBBO,2,"but, I pray you, tell me, is my boy, God rest his"
The Merchant of Venice,2,2,GOBBO,3,"soul, alive or dead?"
The Merchant of Venice,2,2,LAUNCELOT,1,"Do you not know me, father?"
The Merchant of Venice,2,2,GOBBO,1,"Alack, sir, I am sand-blind; I know you not."
The Merchant of Venice,2,2,LAUNCELOT,1,"Nay, indeed, if you had your eyes, you might fail of"
The Merchant of Venice,2,2,LAUNCELOT,2,the knowing me: it is a wise father that knows his
The Merchant of Venice,2,2,LAUNCELOT,3,"own child. Well, old man, I will tell you news of"
The Merchant of Venice,2,2,LAUNCELOT,4,your son: give me your blessing: truth will come
The Merchant of Venice,2,2,LAUNCELOT,5,to light; murder cannot be hid long; a man's son
The Merchant of Venice,2,2,LAUNCELOT,6,"may, but at the length truth will out."
The Merchant of Venice,2,2,GOBBO,1,"Pray you, sir, stand up: I am sure you are not"
The Merchant of Venice,2,2,GOBBO,2,"Launcelot, my boy."
The Merchant of Venice,2,2,LAUNCELOT,1,"Pray you, let's have no more fooling about it, but"
The Merchant of Venice,2,2,LAUNCELOT,2,"give me your blessing: I am Launcelot, your boy"
The Merchant of Venice,2,2,LAUNCELOT,3,"that was, your son that is, your child that shall"
The Merchant of Venice,2,2,LAUNCELOT,4,be.
The Merchant of Venice,2,2,GOBBO,1,I cannot think you are my son.
The Merchant of Venice,2,2,LAUNCELOT,1,I know not what I shall think of that: but I am
The Merchant of Venice,2,2,LAUNCELOT,2,"Launcelot, the Jew's man, and I am sure Margery your"
The Merchant of Venice,2,2,LAUNCELOT,3,wife is my mother.
The Merchant of Venice,2,2,GOBBO,1,"Her name is Margery, indeed: I'll be sworn, if thou"
The Merchant of Venice,2,2,GOBBO,2,"be Launcelot, thou art mine own flesh and blood."
The Merchant of Venice,2,2,GOBBO,3,Lord worshipped might he be! what a beard hast thou
The Merchant of Venice,2,2,GOBBO,4,got! thou hast got more hair on thy chin than
The Merchant of Venice,2,2,GOBBO,5,Dobbin my fill-horse has on his tail.
The Merchant of Venice,2,2,LAUNCELOT,1,"It should seem, then, that Dobbin's tail grows"
The Merchant of Venice,2,2,LAUNCELOT,2,backward: I am sure he had more hair of his tail
The Merchant of Venice,2,2,LAUNCELOT,3,than I have of my face when I last saw him.
The Merchant of Venice,2,2,GOBBO,1,"Lord, how art thou changed! How dost thou and thy"
The Merchant of Venice,2,2,GOBBO,2,master agree? I have brought him a present. How
The Merchant of Venice,2,2,GOBBO,3,'gree you now?
The Merchant of Venice,2,2,LAUNCELOT,1,"Well, well: but, for mine own part, as I have set"
The Merchant of Venice,2,2,LAUNCELOT,2,"up my rest to run away, so I will not rest till I"
The Merchant of Venice,2,2,LAUNCELOT,3,have run some ground. My master's a very Jew: give
The Merchant of Venice,2,2,LAUNCELOT,4,him a present! give him a halter: I am famished in
The Merchant of Venice,2,2,LAUNCELOT,5,his service; you may tell every finger I have with
The Merchant of Venice,2,2,LAUNCELOT,6,"my ribs. Father, I am glad you are come: give me"
The Merchant of Venice,2,2,LAUNCELOT,7,"your present to one Master Bassanio, who, indeed,"
The Merchant of Venice,2,2,LAUNCELOT,8,"gives rare new liveries: if I serve not him, I"
The Merchant of Venice,2,2,LAUNCELOT,9,will run as far as God has any ground. O rare
The Merchant of Venice,2,2,LAUNCELOT,10,"fortune! here comes the man: to him, father; for I"
The Merchant of Venice,2,2,LAUNCELOT,11,"am a Jew, if I serve the Jew any longer."
The Merchant of Venice,2,2,BASSANIO,1,You may do so; but let it be so hasted that supper
The Merchant of Venice,2,2,BASSANIO,2,be ready at the farthest by five of the clock. See
The Merchant of Venice,2,2,BASSANIO,3,"these letters delivered; put the liveries to making,"
The Merchant of Venice,2,2,BASSANIO,4,and desire Gratiano to come anon to my lodging.
The Merchant of Venice,2,2,LAUNCELOT,1,"To him, father."
The Merchant of Venice,2,2,GOBBO,1,God bless your worship!
The Merchant of Venice,2,2,BASSANIO,1,Gramercy! wouldst thou aught with me?
The Merchant of Venice,2,2,GOBBO,1,"Here's my son, sir, a poor boy,--"
The Merchant of Venice,2,2,LAUNCELOT,1,"Not a poor boy, sir, but the rich Jew's man; that"
The Merchant of Venice,2,2,LAUNCELOT,2,"would, sir, as my father shall specify--"
The Merchant of Venice,2,2,GOBBO,1,"He hath a great infection, sir, as one would say, to serve--"
The Merchant of Venice,2,2,LAUNCELOT,1,"Indeed, the short and the long is, I serve the Jew,"
The Merchant of Venice,2,2,LAUNCELOT,2,"and have a desire, as my father shall specify--"
The Merchant of Venice,2,2,GOBBO,1,"His master and he, saving your worship's reverence,"
The Merchant of Venice,2,2,GOBBO,2,are scarce cater-cousins--
The Merchant of Venice,2,2,LAUNCELOT,1,"To be brief, the very truth is that the Jew, having"
The Merchant of Venice,2,2,LAUNCELOT,2,"done me wrong, doth cause me, as my father, being, I"
The Merchant of Venice,2,2,LAUNCELOT,3,"hope, an old man, shall frutify unto you--"
The Merchant of Venice,2,2,GOBBO,1,I have here a dish of doves that I would bestow upon
The Merchant of Venice,2,2,GOBBO,2,"your worship, and my suit is--"
The Merchant of Venice,2,2,LAUNCELOT,1,"In very brief, the suit is impertinent to myself, as"
The Merchant of Venice,2,2,LAUNCELOT,2,"your worship shall know by this honest old man; and,"
The Merchant of Venice,2,2,LAUNCELOT,3,"though I say it, though old man, yet poor man, my father."
The Merchant of Venice,2,2,BASSANIO,1,One speak for both. What would you?
The Merchant of Venice,2,2,LAUNCELOT,1,"Serve you, sir."
The Merchant of Venice,2,2,GOBBO,1,"That is the very defect of the matter, sir."
The Merchant of Venice,2,2,BASSANIO,1,I know thee well; thou hast obtain'd thy suit:
The Merchant of Venice,2,2,BASSANIO,2,"Shylock thy master spoke with me this day,"
The Merchant of Venice,2,2,BASSANIO,3,"And hath preferr'd thee, if it be preferment"
The Merchant of Venice,2,2,BASSANIO,4,"To leave a rich Jew's service, to become"
The Merchant of Venice,2,2,BASSANIO,5,The follower of so poor a gentleman.
The Merchant of Venice,2,2,LAUNCELOT,1,The old proverb is very well parted between my
The Merchant of Venice,2,2,LAUNCELOT,2,"master Shylock and you, sir: you have the grace of"
The Merchant of Venice,2,2,LAUNCELOT,3,"God, sir, and he hath enough."
The Merchant of Venice,2,2,BASSANIO,1,"Thou speak'st it well. Go, father, with thy son."
The Merchant of Venice,2,2,BASSANIO,2,Take leave of thy old master and inquire
The Merchant of Venice,2,2,BASSANIO,3,My lodging out. Give him a livery
The Merchant of Venice,2,2,BASSANIO,4,More guarded than his fellows': see it done.
The Merchant of Venice,2,2,LAUNCELOT,1,"Father, in. I cannot get a service, no; I have"
The Merchant of Venice,2,2,LAUNCELOT,2,"ne'er a tongue in my head. Well, if any man in"
The Merchant of Venice,2,2,LAUNCELOT,3,Italy have a fairer table which doth offer to swear
The Merchant of Venice,2,2,LAUNCELOT,4,"upon a book, I shall have good fortune. Go to,"
The Merchant of Venice,2,2,LAUNCELOT,5,here's a simple line of life: here's a small trifle
The Merchant of Venice,2,2,LAUNCELOT,6,"of wives: alas, fifteen wives is nothing! eleven"
The Merchant of Venice,2,2,LAUNCELOT,7,widows and nine maids is a simple coming-in for one
The Merchant of Venice,2,2,LAUNCELOT,8,"man: and then to 'scape drowning thrice, and to be"
The Merchant of Venice,2,2,LAUNCELOT,9,in peril of my life with the edge of a feather-bed;
The Merchant of Venice,2,2,LAUNCELOT,10,"here are simple scapes. Well, if Fortune be a"
The Merchant of Venice,2,2,LAUNCELOT,11,"woman, she's a good wench for this gear. Father,"
The Merchant of Venice,2,2,LAUNCELOT,12,come; I'll take my leave of the Jew in the twinkling of an eye.
The Merchant of Venice,2,2,BASSANIO,1,"I pray thee, good Leonardo, think on this:"
The Merchant of Venice,2,2,BASSANIO,2,"These things being bought and orderly bestow'd,"
The Merchant of Venice,2,2,BASSANIO,3,"Return in haste, for I do feast to-night"
The Merchant of Venice,2,2,BASSANIO,4,"My best-esteem'd acquaintance: hie thee, go."
The Merchant of Venice,2,2,LEONARDO,1,My best endeavours shall be done herein.
The Merchant of Venice,2,2,GRATIANO,1,Where is your master?
The Merchant of Venice,2,2,LEONARDO,1,"Yonder, sir, he walks."
The Merchant of Venice,2,2,GRATIANO,1,Signior Bassanio!
The Merchant of Venice,2,2,BASSANIO,1,Gratiano!
The Merchant of Venice,2,2,GRATIANO,1,I have a suit to you.
The Merchant of Venice,2,2,BASSANIO,1,You have obtain'd it.
The Merchant of Venice,2,2,GRATIANO,1,You must not deny me: I must go with you to Belmont.
The Merchant of Venice,2,2,BASSANIO,1,"Why then you must. But hear thee, Gratiano;"
The Merchant of Venice,2,2,BASSANIO,2,"Thou art too wild, too rude and bold of voice;"
The Merchant of Venice,2,2,BASSANIO,3,Parts that become thee happily enough
The Merchant of Venice,2,2,BASSANIO,4,And in such eyes as ours appear not faults;
The Merchant of Venice,2,2,BASSANIO,5,"But where thou art not known, why, there they show"
The Merchant of Venice,2,2,BASSANIO,6,"Something too liberal. Pray thee, take pain"
The Merchant of Venice,2,2,BASSANIO,7,To allay with some cold drops of modesty
The Merchant of Venice,2,2,BASSANIO,8,"Thy skipping spirit, lest through thy wild behavior"
The Merchant of Venice,2,2,BASSANIO,9,"I be misconstrued in the place I go to,"
The Merchant of Venice,2,2,BASSANIO,10,And lose my hopes.
The Merchant of Venice,2,2,GRATIANO,1,"Signior Bassanio, hear me:"
The Merchant of Venice,2,2,GRATIANO,2,"If I do not put on a sober habit,"
The Merchant of Venice,2,2,GRATIANO,3,"Talk with respect and swear but now and then,"
The Merchant of Venice,2,2,GRATIANO,4,"Wear prayer-books in my pocket, look demurely,"
The Merchant of Venice,2,2,GRATIANO,5,"Nay more, while grace is saying, hood mine eyes"
The Merchant of Venice,2,2,GRATIANO,6,"Thus with my hat, and sigh and say 'amen,'"
The Merchant of Venice,2,2,GRATIANO,7,"Use all the observance of civility,"
The Merchant of Venice,2,2,GRATIANO,8,Like one well studied in a sad ostent
The Merchant of Venice,2,2,GRATIANO,9,"To please his grandam, never trust me more."
The Merchant of Venice,2,2,BASSANIO,1,"Well, we shall see your bearing."
The Merchant of Venice,2,2,GRATIANO,1,"Nay, but I bar to-night: you shall not gauge me"
The Merchant of Venice,2,2,GRATIANO,2,By what we do to-night.
The Merchant of Venice,2,2,BASSANIO,1,"No, that were pity:"
The Merchant of Venice,2,2,BASSANIO,2,I would entreat you rather to put on
The Merchant of Venice,2,2,BASSANIO,3,"Your boldest suit of mirth, for we have friends"
The Merchant of Venice,2,2,BASSANIO,4,That purpose merriment. But fare you well:
The Merchant of Venice,2,2,BASSANIO,5,I have some business.
The Merchant of Venice,2,2,GRATIANO,1,And I must to Lorenzo and the rest:
The Merchant of Venice,2,2,GRATIANO,2,But we will visit you at supper-time.
The Merchant of Venice,2,3,JESSICA,1,I am sorry thou wilt leave my father so:
The Merchant of Venice,2,3,JESSICA,2,"Our house is hell, and thou, a merry devil,"
The Merchant of Venice,2,3,JESSICA,3,Didst rob it of some taste of tediousness.
The Merchant of Venice,2,3,JESSICA,4,"But fare thee well, there is a ducat for thee:"
The Merchant of Venice,2,3,JESSICA,5,"And, Launcelot, soon at supper shalt thou see"
The Merchant of Venice,2,3,JESSICA,6,"Lorenzo, who is thy new master's guest:"
The Merchant of Venice,2,3,JESSICA,7,Give him this letter; do it secretly;
The Merchant of Venice,2,3,JESSICA,8,And so farewell: I would not have my father
The Merchant of Venice,2,3,JESSICA,9,See me in talk with thee.
The Merchant of Venice,2,3,LAUNCELOT,1,Adieu! tears exhibit my tongue. Most beautiful
The Merchant of Venice,2,3,LAUNCELOT,2,"pagan, most sweet Jew! if a Christian did not play"
The Merchant of Venice,2,3,LAUNCELOT,3,"the knave and get thee, I am much deceived. But,"
The Merchant of Venice,2,3,LAUNCELOT,4,adieu: these foolish drops do something drown my
The Merchant of Venice,2,3,LAUNCELOT,5,manly spirit: adieu.
The Merchant of Venice,2,3,JESSICA,1,"Farewell, good Launcelot."
The Merchant of Venice,2,3,JESSICA,2,"Alack, what heinous sin is it in me"
The Merchant of Venice,2,3,JESSICA,3,To be ashamed to be my father's child!
The Merchant of Venice,2,3,JESSICA,4,"But though I am a daughter to his blood,"
The Merchant of Venice,2,3,JESSICA,5,"I am not to his manners. O Lorenzo,"
The Merchant of Venice,2,3,JESSICA,6,"If thou keep promise, I shall end this strife,"
The Merchant of Venice,2,3,JESSICA,7,Become a Christian and thy loving wife.
The Merchant of Venice,2,4,LORENZO,1,"Nay, we will slink away in supper-time,"
The Merchant of Venice,2,4,LORENZO,2,"Disguise us at my lodging and return,"
The Merchant of Venice,2,4,LORENZO,3,All in an hour.
The Merchant of Venice,2,4,GRATIANO,1,We have not made good preparation.
The Merchant of Venice,2,4,SALARINO,1,We have not spoke us yet of torchbearers.
The Merchant of Venice,2,4,SALANIO,1,"'Tis vile, unless it may be quaintly order'd,"
The Merchant of Venice,2,4,SALANIO,2,And better in my mind not undertook.
The Merchant of Venice,2,4,LORENZO,1,'Tis now but four o'clock: we have two hours
The Merchant of Venice,2,4,LORENZO,2,To furnish us.
The Merchant of Venice,2,4,LORENZO,3,"Friend Launcelot, what's the news?"
The Merchant of Venice,2,4,LAUNCELOT,1,An it shall please you to break up
The Merchant of Venice,2,4,LAUNCELOT,2,"this, it shall seem to signify."
The Merchant of Venice,2,4,LORENZO,1,"I know the hand: in faith, 'tis a fair hand;"
The Merchant of Venice,2,4,LORENZO,2,And whiter than the paper it writ on
The Merchant of Venice,2,4,LORENZO,3,Is the fair hand that writ.
The Merchant of Venice,2,4,GRATIANO,1,"Love-news, in faith."
The Merchant of Venice,2,4,LAUNCELOT,1,"By your leave, sir."
The Merchant of Venice,2,4,LORENZO,1,Whither goest thou?
The Merchant of Venice,2,4,LAUNCELOT,1,"Marry, sir, to bid my old master the"
The Merchant of Venice,2,4,LAUNCELOT,2,Jew to sup to-night with my new master the Christian.
The Merchant of Venice,2,4,LORENZO,1,"Hold here, take this: tell gentle Jessica"
The Merchant of Venice,2,4,LORENZO,2,I will not fail her; speak it privately.
The Merchant of Venice,2,4,LORENZO,3,"Go, gentlemen,"
The Merchant of Venice,2,4,LORENZO,4,Will you prepare you for this masque tonight?
The Merchant of Venice,2,4,LORENZO,5,I am provided of a torch-bearer.
The Merchant of Venice,2,4,SALANIO,1,"Ay, marry, I'll be gone about it straight."
The Merchant of Venice,2,4,SALANIO,1,And so will I.
The Merchant of Venice,2,4,LORENZO,1,Meet me and Gratiano
The Merchant of Venice,2,4,LORENZO,2,At Gratiano's lodging some hour hence.
The Merchant of Venice,2,4,SALARINO,1,'Tis good we do so.
The Merchant of Venice,2,4,GRATIANO,1,Was not that letter from fair Jessica?
The Merchant of Venice,2,4,LORENZO,1,I must needs tell thee all. She hath directed
The Merchant of Venice,2,4,LORENZO,2,"How I shall take her from her father's house,"
The Merchant of Venice,2,4,LORENZO,3,"What gold and jewels she is furnish'd with,"
The Merchant of Venice,2,4,LORENZO,4,What page's suit she hath in readiness.
The Merchant of Venice,2,4,LORENZO,5,"If e'er the Jew her father come to heaven,"
The Merchant of Venice,2,4,LORENZO,6,It will be for his gentle daughter's sake:
The Merchant of Venice,2,4,LORENZO,7,"And never dare misfortune cross her foot,"
The Merchant of Venice,2,4,LORENZO,8,"Unless she do it under this excuse,"
The Merchant of Venice,2,4,LORENZO,9,That she is issue to a faithless Jew.
The Merchant of Venice,2,4,LORENZO,10,"Come, go with me; peruse this as thou goest:"
The Merchant of Venice,2,4,LORENZO,11,Fair Jessica shall be my torch-bearer.
The Merchant of Venice,2,5,SHYLOCK,1,"Well, thou shalt see, thy eyes shall be thy judge,"
The Merchant of Venice,2,5,SHYLOCK,2,The difference of old Shylock and Bassanio:--
The Merchant of Venice,2,5,SHYLOCK,3,"What, Jessica!--thou shalt not gormandise,"
The Merchant of Venice,2,5,SHYLOCK,4,"As thou hast done with me:--What, Jessica!--"
The Merchant of Venice,2,5,SHYLOCK,5,"And sleep and snore, and rend apparel out;--"
The Merchant of Venice,2,5,SHYLOCK,6,"Why, Jessica, I say!"
The Merchant of Venice,2,5,LAUNCELOT,1,"Why, Jessica!"
The Merchant of Venice,2,5,SHYLOCK,1,Who bids thee call? I do not bid thee call.
The Merchant of Venice,2,5,LAUNCELOT,1,Your worship was wont to tell me that
The Merchant of Venice,2,5,LAUNCELOT,2,I could do nothing without bidding.
The Merchant of Venice,2,5,JESSICA,1,Call you? what is your will?
The Merchant of Venice,2,5,SHYLOCK,1,"I am bid forth to supper, Jessica:"
The Merchant of Venice,2,5,SHYLOCK,2,There are my keys. But wherefore should I go?
The Merchant of Venice,2,5,SHYLOCK,3,I am not bid for love; they flatter me:
The Merchant of Venice,2,5,SHYLOCK,4,"But yet I'll go in hate, to feed upon"
The Merchant of Venice,2,5,SHYLOCK,5,"The prodigal Christian. Jessica, my girl,"
The Merchant of Venice,2,5,SHYLOCK,6,Look to my house. I am right loath to go:
The Merchant of Venice,2,5,SHYLOCK,7,"There is some ill a-brewing towards my rest,"
The Merchant of Venice,2,5,SHYLOCK,8,For I did dream of money-bags to-night.
The Merchant of Venice,2,5,LAUNCELOT,1,"I beseech you, sir, go: my young master doth expect"
The Merchant of Venice,2,5,LAUNCELOT,2,your reproach.
The Merchant of Venice,2,5,SHYLOCK,1,So do I his.
The Merchant of Venice,2,5,LAUNCELOT,1,"An they have conspired together, I will not say you"
The Merchant of Venice,2,5,LAUNCELOT,2,"shall see a masque; but if you do, then it was not"
The Merchant of Venice,2,5,LAUNCELOT,3,for nothing that my nose fell a-bleeding on
The Merchant of Venice,2,5,LAUNCELOT,4,"Black-Monday last at six o'clock i' the morning,"
The Merchant of Venice,2,5,LAUNCELOT,5,falling out that year on Ash-Wednesday was four
The Merchant of Venice,2,5,LAUNCELOT,6,"year, in the afternoon."
The Merchant of Venice,2,5,SHYLOCK,1,"What, are there masques? Hear you me, Jessica:"
The Merchant of Venice,2,5,SHYLOCK,2,Lock up my doors; and when you hear the drum
The Merchant of Venice,2,5,SHYLOCK,3,"And the vile squealing of the wry-neck'd fife,"
The Merchant of Venice,2,5,SHYLOCK,4,"Clamber not you up to the casements then,"
The Merchant of Venice,2,5,SHYLOCK,5,Nor thrust your head into the public street
The Merchant of Venice,2,5,SHYLOCK,6,"To gaze on Christian fools with varnish'd faces,"
The Merchant of Venice,2,5,SHYLOCK,7,"But stop my house's ears, I mean my casements:"
The Merchant of Venice,2,5,SHYLOCK,8,Let not the sound of shallow foppery enter
The Merchant of Venice,2,5,SHYLOCK,9,"My sober house. By Jacob's staff, I swear,"
The Merchant of Venice,2,5,SHYLOCK,10,I have no mind of feasting forth to-night:
The Merchant of Venice,2,5,SHYLOCK,11,"But I will go. Go you before me, sirrah;"
The Merchant of Venice,2,5,SHYLOCK,12,Say I will come.
The Merchant of Venice,2,5,LAUNCELOT,1,"I will go before, sir. Mistress, look out at"
The Merchant of Venice,2,5,LAUNCELOT,2,"window, for all this, There will come a Christian"
The Merchant of Venice,2,5,LAUNCELOT,3,"boy, will be worth a Jewess' eye."
The Merchant of Venice,2,5,SHYLOCK,1,"What says that fool of Hagar's offspring, ha?"
The Merchant of Venice,2,5,JESSICA,1,His words were 'Farewell mistress;' nothing else.
The Merchant of Venice,2,5,SHYLOCK,1,"The patch is kind enough, but a huge feeder;"
The Merchant of Venice,2,5,SHYLOCK,2,"Snail-slow in profit, and he sleeps by day"
The Merchant of Venice,2,5,SHYLOCK,3,More than the wild-cat: drones hive not with me;
The Merchant of Venice,2,5,SHYLOCK,4,"Therefore I part with him, and part with him"
The Merchant of Venice,2,5,SHYLOCK,5,To one that would have him help to waste
The Merchant of Venice,2,5,SHYLOCK,6,"His borrow'd purse. Well, Jessica, go in;"
The Merchant of Venice,2,5,SHYLOCK,7,Perhaps I will return immediately:
The Merchant of Venice,2,5,SHYLOCK,8,Do as I bid you; shut doors after you:
The Merchant of Venice,2,5,SHYLOCK,9,"Fast bind, fast find;"
The Merchant of Venice,2,5,SHYLOCK,10,A proverb never stale in thrifty mind.
The Merchant of Venice,2,5,JESSICA,1,"Farewell; and if my fortune be not crost,"
The Merchant of Venice,2,5,JESSICA,2,"I have a father, you a daughter, lost."
The Merchant of Venice,2,6,GRATIANO,1,This is the pent-house under which Lorenzo
The Merchant of Venice,2,6,GRATIANO,2,Desired us to make stand.
The Merchant of Venice,2,6,SALARINO,1,His hour is almost past.
The Merchant of Venice,2,6,GRATIANO,1,"And it is marvel he out-dwells his hour,"
The Merchant of Venice,2,6,GRATIANO,2,For lovers ever run before the clock.
The Merchant of Venice,2,6,SALARINO,1,"O, ten times faster Venus' pigeons fly"
The Merchant of Venice,2,6,SALARINO,2,"To seal love's bonds new-made, than they are wont"
The Merchant of Venice,2,6,SALARINO,3,To keep obliged faith unforfeited!
The Merchant of Venice,2,6,GRATIANO,1,That ever holds: who riseth from a feast
The Merchant of Venice,2,6,GRATIANO,2,With that keen appetite that he sits down?
The Merchant of Venice,2,6,GRATIANO,3,Where is the horse that doth untread again
The Merchant of Venice,2,6,GRATIANO,4,His tedious measures with the unbated fire
The Merchant of Venice,2,6,GRATIANO,5,"That he did pace them first? All things that are,"
The Merchant of Venice,2,6,GRATIANO,6,Are with more spirit chased than enjoy'd.
The Merchant of Venice,2,6,GRATIANO,7,How like a younker or a prodigal
The Merchant of Venice,2,6,GRATIANO,8,"The scarfed bark puts from her native bay,"
The Merchant of Venice,2,6,GRATIANO,9,Hugg'd and embraced by the strumpet wind!
The Merchant of Venice,2,6,GRATIANO,10,"How like the prodigal doth she return,"
The Merchant of Venice,2,6,GRATIANO,11,"With over-weather'd ribs and ragged sails,"
The Merchant of Venice,2,6,GRATIANO,12,"Lean, rent and beggar'd by the strumpet wind!"
The Merchant of Venice,2,6,SALARINO,1,Here comes Lorenzo: more of this hereafter.
The Merchant of Venice,2,6,LORENZO,1,"Sweet friends, your patience for my long abode;"
The Merchant of Venice,2,6,LORENZO,2,"Not I, but my affairs, have made you wait:"
The Merchant of Venice,2,6,LORENZO,3,"When you shall please to play the thieves for wives,"
The Merchant of Venice,2,6,LORENZO,4,I'll watch as long for you then. Approach;
The Merchant of Venice,2,6,LORENZO,5,Here dwells my father Jew. Ho! who's within?
The Merchant of Venice,2,6,JESSICA,1,"Who are you? Tell me, for more certainty,"
The Merchant of Venice,2,6,JESSICA,2,Albeit I'll swear that I do know your tongue.
The Merchant of Venice,2,6,LORENZO,1,"Lorenzo, and thy love."
The Merchant of Venice,2,6,JESSICA,1,"Lorenzo, certain, and my love indeed,"
The Merchant of Venice,2,6,JESSICA,2,For who love I so much? And now who knows
The Merchant of Venice,2,6,JESSICA,3,"But you, Lorenzo, whether I am yours?"
The Merchant of Venice,2,6,LORENZO,1,Heaven and thy thoughts are witness that thou art.
The Merchant of Venice,2,6,JESSICA,1,"Here, catch this casket; it is worth the pains."
The Merchant of Venice,2,6,JESSICA,2,"I am glad 'tis night, you do not look on me,"
The Merchant of Venice,2,6,JESSICA,3,For I am much ashamed of my exchange:
The Merchant of Venice,2,6,JESSICA,4,But love is blind and lovers cannot see
The Merchant of Venice,2,6,JESSICA,5,The pretty follies that themselves commit;
The Merchant of Venice,2,6,JESSICA,6,"For if they could, Cupid himself would blush"
The Merchant of Venice,2,6,JESSICA,7,To see me thus transformed to a boy.
The Merchant of Venice,2,6,LORENZO,1,"Descend, for you must be my torchbearer."
The Merchant of Venice,2,6,JESSICA,1,"What, must I hold a candle to my shames?"
The Merchant of Venice,2,6,JESSICA,2,"They in themselves, good-sooth, are too too light."
The Merchant of Venice,2,6,JESSICA,3,"Why, 'tis an office of discovery, love;"
The Merchant of Venice,2,6,JESSICA,4,And I should be obscured.
The Merchant of Venice,2,6,LORENZO,1,"So are you, sweet,"
The Merchant of Venice,2,6,LORENZO,2,Even in the lovely garnish of a boy.
The Merchant of Venice,2,6,LORENZO,3,But come at once;
The Merchant of Venice,2,6,LORENZO,4,"For the close night doth play the runaway,"
The Merchant of Venice,2,6,LORENZO,5,And we are stay'd for at Bassanio's feast.
The Merchant of Venice,2,6,JESSICA,1,"I will make fast the doors, and gild myself"
The Merchant of Venice,2,6,JESSICA,2,"With some more ducats, and be with you straight."
The Merchant of Venice,2,6,GRATIANO,1,"Now, by my hood, a Gentile and no Jew."
The Merchant of Venice,2,6,LORENZO,1,Beshrew me but I love her heartily;
The Merchant of Venice,2,6,LORENZO,2,"For she is wise, if I can judge of her,"
The Merchant of Venice,2,6,LORENZO,3,"And fair she is, if that mine eyes be true,"
The Merchant of Venice,2,6,LORENZO,4,"And true she is, as she hath proved herself,"
The Merchant of Venice,2,6,LORENZO,5,"And therefore, like herself, wise, fair and true,"
The Merchant of Venice,2,6,LORENZO,6,Shall she be placed in my constant soul.
The Merchant of Venice,2,6,LORENZO,7,"What, art thou come? On, gentlemen; away!"
The Merchant of Venice,2,6,LORENZO,8,Our masquing mates by this time for us stay.
The Merchant of Venice,2,6,ANTONIO,1,Who's there?
The Merchant of Venice,2,6,GRATIANO,1,Signior Antonio!
The Merchant of Venice,2,6,ANTONIO,1,"Fie, fie, Gratiano! where are all the rest?"
The Merchant of Venice,2,6,ANTONIO,2,'Tis nine o'clock: our friends all stay for you.
The Merchant of Venice,2,6,ANTONIO,3,No masque to-night: the wind is come about;
The Merchant of Venice,2,6,ANTONIO,4,Bassanio presently will go aboard:
The Merchant of Venice,2,6,ANTONIO,5,I have sent twenty out to seek for you.
The Merchant of Venice,2,6,GRATIANO,1,I am glad on't: I desire no more delight
The Merchant of Venice,2,6,GRATIANO,2,Than to be under sail and gone to-night.
The Merchant of Venice,2,7,PORTIA,1,Go draw aside the curtains and discover
The Merchant of Venice,2,7,PORTIA,2,The several caskets to this noble prince.
The Merchant of Venice,2,7,PORTIA,3,Now make your choice.
The Merchant of Venice,2,7,MOROCCO,1,"The first, of gold, who this inscription bears,"
The Merchant of Venice,2,7,MOROCCO,2,'Who chooseth me shall gain what many men desire;'
The Merchant of Venice,2,7,MOROCCO,3,"The second, silver, which this promise carries,"
The Merchant of Venice,2,7,MOROCCO,4,'Who chooseth me shall get as much as he deserves;'
The Merchant of Venice,2,7,MOROCCO,5,"This third, dull lead, with warning all as blunt,"
The Merchant of Venice,2,7,MOROCCO,6,'Who chooseth me must give and hazard all he hath.'
The Merchant of Venice,2,7,MOROCCO,7,How shall I know if I do choose the right?
The Merchant of Venice,2,7,PORTIA,1,"The one of them contains my picture, prince:"
The Merchant of Venice,2,7,PORTIA,2,"If you choose that, then I am yours withal."
The Merchant of Venice,2,7,MOROCCO,1,Some god direct my judgment! Let me see;
The Merchant of Venice,2,7,MOROCCO,2,I will survey the inscriptions back again.
The Merchant of Venice,2,7,MOROCCO,3,What says this leaden casket?
The Merchant of Venice,2,7,MOROCCO,4,'Who chooseth me must give and hazard all he hath.'
The Merchant of Venice,2,7,MOROCCO,5,Must give: for what? for lead? hazard for lead?
The Merchant of Venice,2,7,MOROCCO,6,This casket threatens. Men that hazard all
The Merchant of Venice,2,7,MOROCCO,7,Do it in hope of fair advantages:
The Merchant of Venice,2,7,MOROCCO,8,A golden mind stoops not to shows of dross;
The Merchant of Venice,2,7,MOROCCO,9,I'll then nor give nor hazard aught for lead.
The Merchant of Venice,2,7,MOROCCO,10,What says the silver with her virgin hue?
The Merchant of Venice,2,7,MOROCCO,11,'Who chooseth me shall get as much as he deserves.'
The Merchant of Venice,2,7,MOROCCO,12,"As much as he deserves! Pause there, Morocco,"
The Merchant of Venice,2,7,MOROCCO,13,And weigh thy value with an even hand:
The Merchant of Venice,2,7,MOROCCO,14,"If thou be'st rated by thy estimation,"
The Merchant of Venice,2,7,MOROCCO,15,Thou dost deserve enough; and yet enough
The Merchant of Venice,2,7,MOROCCO,16,May not extend so far as to the lady:
The Merchant of Venice,2,7,MOROCCO,17,And yet to be afeard of my deserving
The Merchant of Venice,2,7,MOROCCO,18,Were but a weak disabling of myself.
The Merchant of Venice,2,7,MOROCCO,19,"As much as I deserve! Why, that's the lady:"
The Merchant of Venice,2,7,MOROCCO,20,"I do in birth deserve her, and in fortunes,"
The Merchant of Venice,2,7,MOROCCO,21,In graces and in qualities of breeding;
The Merchant of Venice,2,7,MOROCCO,22,"But more than these, in love I do deserve."
The Merchant of Venice,2,7,MOROCCO,23,"What if I stray'd no further, but chose here?"
The Merchant of Venice,2,7,MOROCCO,24,Let's see once more this saying graved in gold
The Merchant of Venice,2,7,MOROCCO,25,'Who chooseth me shall gain what many men desire.'
The Merchant of Venice,2,7,MOROCCO,26,"Why, that's the lady; all the world desires her;"
The Merchant of Venice,2,7,MOROCCO,27,"From the four corners of the earth they come,"
The Merchant of Venice,2,7,MOROCCO,28,"To kiss this shrine, this mortal-breathing saint:"
The Merchant of Venice,2,7,MOROCCO,29,The Hyrcanian deserts and the vasty wilds
The Merchant of Venice,2,7,MOROCCO,30,Of wide Arabia are as thoroughfares now
The Merchant of Venice,2,7,MOROCCO,31,For princes to come view fair Portia:
The Merchant of Venice,2,7,MOROCCO,32,"The watery kingdom, whose ambitious head"
The Merchant of Venice,2,7,MOROCCO,33,"Spits in the face of heaven, is no bar"
The Merchant of Venice,2,7,MOROCCO,34,"To stop the foreign spirits, but they come,"
The Merchant of Venice,2,7,MOROCCO,35,"As o'er a brook, to see fair Portia."
The Merchant of Venice,2,7,MOROCCO,36,One of these three contains her heavenly picture.
The Merchant of Venice,2,7,MOROCCO,37,Is't like that lead contains her? 'Twere damnation
The Merchant of Venice,2,7,MOROCCO,38,To think so base a thought: it were too gross
The Merchant of Venice,2,7,MOROCCO,39,To rib her cerecloth in the obscure grave.
The Merchant of Venice,2,7,MOROCCO,40,"Or shall I think in silver she's immured,"
The Merchant of Venice,2,7,MOROCCO,41,Being ten times undervalued to tried gold?
The Merchant of Venice,2,7,MOROCCO,42,O sinful thought! Never so rich a gem
The Merchant of Venice,2,7,MOROCCO,43,Was set in worse than gold. They have in England
The Merchant of Venice,2,7,MOROCCO,44,A coin that bears the figure of an angel
The Merchant of Venice,2,7,MOROCCO,45,"Stamped in gold, but that's insculp'd upon;"
The Merchant of Venice,2,7,MOROCCO,46,But here an angel in a golden bed
The Merchant of Venice,2,7,MOROCCO,47,Lies all within. Deliver me the key:
The Merchant of Venice,2,7,MOROCCO,48,"Here do I choose, and thrive I as I may!"
The Merchant of Venice,2,7,PORTIA,1,"There, take it, prince; and if my form lie there,"
The Merchant of Venice,2,7,PORTIA,2,Then I am yours.
The Merchant of Venice,2,7,MOROCCO,1,O hell! what have we here?
The Merchant of Venice,2,7,MOROCCO,2,"A carrion Death, within whose empty eye"
The Merchant of Venice,2,7,MOROCCO,3,There is a written scroll! I'll read the writing.
The Merchant of Venice,2,7,MOROCCO,4,All that glitters is not gold;
The Merchant of Venice,2,7,MOROCCO,5,Often have you heard that told:
The Merchant of Venice,2,7,MOROCCO,6,Many a man his life hath sold
The Merchant of Venice,2,7,MOROCCO,7,But my outside to behold:
The Merchant of Venice,2,7,MOROCCO,8,Gilded tombs do worms enfold.
The Merchant of Venice,2,7,MOROCCO,9,"Had you been as wise as bold,"
The Merchant of Venice,2,7,MOROCCO,10,"Young in limbs, in judgment old,"
The Merchant of Venice,2,7,MOROCCO,11,Your answer had not been inscroll'd:
The Merchant of Venice,2,7,MOROCCO,12,Fare you well; your suit is cold.
The Merchant of Venice,2,7,MOROCCO,13,"Cold, indeed; and labour lost:"
The Merchant of Venice,2,7,MOROCCO,14,"Then, farewell, heat, and welcome, frost!"
The Merchant of Venice,2,7,MOROCCO,15,"Portia, adieu. I have too grieved a heart"
The Merchant of Venice,2,7,MOROCCO,16,To take a tedious leave: thus losers part.
The Merchant of Venice,2,7,PORTIA,1,"A gentle riddance. Draw the curtains, go."
The Merchant of Venice,2,7,PORTIA,2,Let all of his complexion choose me so.
The Merchant of Venice,2,8,SALARINO,1,"Why, man, I saw Bassanio under sail:"
The Merchant of Venice,2,8,SALARINO,2,With him is Gratiano gone along;
The Merchant of Venice,2,8,SALARINO,3,And in their ship I am sure Lorenzo is not.
The Merchant of Venice,2,8,SALANIO,1,"The villain Jew with outcries raised the duke,"
The Merchant of Venice,2,8,SALANIO,2,Who went with him to search Bassanio's ship.
The Merchant of Venice,2,8,SALARINO,1,"He came too late, the ship was under sail:"
The Merchant of Venice,2,8,SALARINO,2,But there the duke was given to understand
The Merchant of Venice,2,8,SALARINO,3,That in a gondola were seen together
The Merchant of Venice,2,8,SALARINO,4,Lorenzo and his amorous Jessica:
The Merchant of Venice,2,8,SALARINO,5,"Besides, Antonio certified the duke"
The Merchant of Venice,2,8,SALARINO,6,They were not with Bassanio in his ship.
The Merchant of Venice,2,8,SALANIO,1,"I never heard a passion so confused,"
The Merchant of Venice,2,8,SALANIO,2,"So strange, outrageous, and so variable,"
The Merchant of Venice,2,8,SALANIO,3,As the dog Jew did utter in the streets:
The Merchant of Venice,2,8,SALANIO,4,'My daughter! O my ducats! O my daughter!
The Merchant of Venice,2,8,SALANIO,5,Fled with a Christian! O my Christian ducats!
The Merchant of Venice,2,8,SALANIO,6,"Justice! the law! my ducats, and my daughter!"
The Merchant of Venice,2,8,SALANIO,7,"A sealed bag, two sealed bags of ducats,"
The Merchant of Venice,2,8,SALANIO,8,"Of double ducats, stolen from me by my daughter!"
The Merchant of Venice,2,8,SALANIO,9,"And jewels, two stones, two rich and precious stones,"
The Merchant of Venice,2,8,SALANIO,10,Stolen by my daughter! Justice! find the girl;
The Merchant of Venice,2,8,SALANIO,11,"She hath the stones upon her, and the ducats.'"
The Merchant of Venice,2,8,SALARINO,1,"Why, all the boys in Venice follow him,"
The Merchant of Venice,2,8,SALARINO,2,"Crying, his stones, his daughter, and his ducats."
The Merchant of Venice,2,8,SALANIO,1,"Let good Antonio look he keep his day,"
The Merchant of Venice,2,8,SALANIO,2,Or he shall pay for this.
The Merchant of Venice,2,8,SALARINO,1,"Marry, well remember'd."
The Merchant of Venice,2,8,SALARINO,2,"I reason'd with a Frenchman yesterday,"
The Merchant of Venice,2,8,SALARINO,3,"Who told me, in the narrow seas that part"
The Merchant of Venice,2,8,SALARINO,4,"The French and English, there miscarried"
The Merchant of Venice,2,8,SALARINO,5,A vessel of our country richly fraught:
The Merchant of Venice,2,8,SALARINO,6,I thought upon Antonio when he told me;
The Merchant of Venice,2,8,SALARINO,7,And wish'd in silence that it were not his.
The Merchant of Venice,2,8,SALANIO,1,You were best to tell Antonio what you hear;
The Merchant of Venice,2,8,SALANIO,2,"Yet do not suddenly, for it may grieve him."
The Merchant of Venice,2,8,SALARINO,1,A kinder gentleman treads not the earth.
The Merchant of Venice,2,8,SALARINO,2,I saw Bassanio and Antonio part:
The Merchant of Venice,2,8,SALARINO,3,Bassanio told him he would make some speed
The Merchant of Venice,2,8,SALARINO,4,"Of his return: he answer'd, 'Do not so;"
The Merchant of Venice,2,8,SALARINO,5,"Slubber not business for my sake, Bassanio"
The Merchant of Venice,2,8,SALARINO,6,But stay the very riping of the time;
The Merchant of Venice,2,8,SALARINO,7,"And for the Jew's bond which he hath of me,"
The Merchant of Venice,2,8,SALARINO,8,Let it not enter in your mind of love:
The Merchant of Venice,2,8,SALARINO,9,"Be merry, and employ your chiefest thoughts"
The Merchant of Venice,2,8,SALARINO,10,To courtship and such fair ostents of love
The Merchant of Venice,2,8,SALARINO,11,As shall conveniently become you there:'
The Merchant of Venice,2,8,SALARINO,12,"And even there, his eye being big with tears,"
The Merchant of Venice,2,8,SALARINO,13,"Turning his face, he put his hand behind him,"
The Merchant of Venice,2,8,SALARINO,14,And with affection wondrous sensible
The Merchant of Venice,2,8,SALARINO,15,He wrung Bassanio's hand; and so they parted.
The Merchant of Venice,2,8,SALANIO,1,I think he only loves the world for him.
The Merchant of Venice,2,8,SALANIO,2,"I pray thee, let us go and find him out"
The Merchant of Venice,2,8,SALANIO,3,And quicken his embraced heaviness
The Merchant of Venice,2,8,SALANIO,4,With some delight or other.
The Merchant of Venice,2,8,SALARINO,1,Do we so.
The Merchant of Venice,2,9,NERISSA,1,"Quick, quick, I pray thee; draw the curtain straight:"
The Merchant of Venice,2,9,NERISSA,2,"The Prince of Arragon hath ta'en his oath,"
The Merchant of Venice,2,9,NERISSA,3,And comes to his election presently.
The Merchant of Venice,2,9,PORTIA,1,"Behold, there stand the caskets, noble prince:"
The Merchant of Venice,2,9,PORTIA,2,"If you choose that wherein I am contain'd,"
The Merchant of Venice,2,9,PORTIA,3,Straight shall our nuptial rites be solemnized:
The Merchant of Venice,2,9,PORTIA,4,"But if you fail, without more speech, my lord,"
The Merchant of Venice,2,9,PORTIA,5,You must be gone from hence immediately.
The Merchant of Venice,2,9,ARRAGON,1,I am enjoin'd by oath to observe three things:
The Merchant of Venice,2,9,ARRAGON,2,"First, never to unfold to any one"
The Merchant of Venice,2,9,ARRAGON,3,"Which casket 'twas I chose; next, if I fail"
The Merchant of Venice,2,9,ARRAGON,4,"Of the right casket, never in my life"
The Merchant of Venice,2,9,ARRAGON,5,"To woo a maid in way of marriage: Lastly,"
The Merchant of Venice,2,9,ARRAGON,6,"If I do fail in fortune of my choice,"
The Merchant of Venice,2,9,ARRAGON,7,Immediately to leave you and be gone.
The Merchant of Venice,2,9,PORTIA,1,To these injunctions every one doth swear
The Merchant of Venice,2,9,PORTIA,2,That comes to hazard for my worthless self.
The Merchant of Venice,2,9,ARRAGON,1,And so have I address'd me. Fortune now
The Merchant of Venice,2,9,ARRAGON,2,To my heart's hope! Gold; silver; and base lead.
The Merchant of Venice,2,9,ARRAGON,3,'Who chooseth me must give and hazard all he hath.'
The Merchant of Venice,2,9,ARRAGON,4,"You shall look fairer, ere I give or hazard."
The Merchant of Venice,2,9,ARRAGON,5,What says the golden chest? ha! let me see:
The Merchant of Venice,2,9,ARRAGON,6,'Who chooseth me shall gain what many men desire.'
The Merchant of Venice,2,9,ARRAGON,7,What many men desire! that 'many' may be meant
The Merchant of Venice,2,9,ARRAGON,8,"By the fool multitude, that choose by show,"
The Merchant of Venice,2,9,ARRAGON,9,Not learning more than the fond eye doth teach;
The Merchant of Venice,2,9,ARRAGON,10,"Which pries not to the interior, but, like the martlet,"
The Merchant of Venice,2,9,ARRAGON,11,"Builds in the weather on the outward wall,"
The Merchant of Venice,2,9,ARRAGON,12,Even in the force and road of casualty.
The Merchant of Venice,2,9,ARRAGON,13,"I will not choose what many men desire,"
The Merchant of Venice,2,9,ARRAGON,14,Because I will not jump with common spirits
The Merchant of Venice,2,9,ARRAGON,15,And rank me with the barbarous multitudes.
The Merchant of Venice,2,9,ARRAGON,16,"Why, then to thee, thou silver treasure-house;"
The Merchant of Venice,2,9,ARRAGON,17,Tell me once more what title thou dost bear:
The Merchant of Venice,2,9,ARRAGON,18,'Who chooseth me shall get as much as he deserves:'
The Merchant of Venice,2,9,ARRAGON,19,And well said too; for who shall go about
The Merchant of Venice,2,9,ARRAGON,20,To cozen fortune and be honourable
The Merchant of Venice,2,9,ARRAGON,21,Without the stamp of merit? Let none presume
The Merchant of Venice,2,9,ARRAGON,22,To wear an undeserved dignity.
The Merchant of Venice,2,9,ARRAGON,23,"O, that estates, degrees and offices"
The Merchant of Venice,2,9,ARRAGON,24,"Were not derived corruptly, and that clear honour"
The Merchant of Venice,2,9,ARRAGON,25,Were purchased by the merit of the wearer!
The Merchant of Venice,2,9,ARRAGON,26,How many then should cover that stand bare!
The Merchant of Venice,2,9,ARRAGON,27,How many be commanded that command!
The Merchant of Venice,2,9,ARRAGON,28,How much low peasantry would then be glean'd
The Merchant of Venice,2,9,ARRAGON,29,From the true seed of honour! and how much honour
The Merchant of Venice,2,9,ARRAGON,30,Pick'd from the chaff and ruin of the times
The Merchant of Venice,2,9,ARRAGON,31,"To be new-varnish'd! Well, but to my choice:"
The Merchant of Venice,2,9,ARRAGON,32,'Who chooseth me shall get as much as he deserves.'
The Merchant of Venice,2,9,ARRAGON,33,"I will assume desert. Give me a key for this,"
The Merchant of Venice,2,9,ARRAGON,34,And instantly unlock my fortunes here.
The Merchant of Venice,2,9,PORTIA,1,Too long a pause for that which you find there.
The Merchant of Venice,2,9,ARRAGON,1,"What's here? the portrait of a blinking idiot,"
The Merchant of Venice,2,9,ARRAGON,2,Presenting me a schedule! I will read it.
The Merchant of Venice,2,9,ARRAGON,3,How much unlike art thou to Portia!
The Merchant of Venice,2,9,ARRAGON,4,How much unlike my hopes and my deservings!
The Merchant of Venice,2,9,ARRAGON,5,'Who chooseth me shall have as much as he deserves.'
The Merchant of Venice,2,9,ARRAGON,6,Did I deserve no more than a fool's head?
The Merchant of Venice,2,9,ARRAGON,7,Is that my prize? are my deserts no better?
The Merchant of Venice,2,9,PORTIA,1,"To offend, and judge, are distinct offices"
The Merchant of Venice,2,9,PORTIA,2,And of opposed natures.
The Merchant of Venice,2,9,ARRAGON,1,What is here?
The Merchant of Venice,2,9,ARRAGON,2,The fire seven times tried this:
The Merchant of Venice,2,9,ARRAGON,3,"Seven times tried that judgment is,"
The Merchant of Venice,2,9,ARRAGON,4,That did never choose amiss.
The Merchant of Venice,2,9,ARRAGON,5,Some there be that shadows kiss;
The Merchant of Venice,2,9,ARRAGON,6,Such have but a shadow's bliss:
The Merchant of Venice,2,9,ARRAGON,7,"There be fools alive, I wis,"
The Merchant of Venice,2,9,ARRAGON,8,Silver'd o'er; and so was this.
The Merchant of Venice,2,9,ARRAGON,9,"Take what wife you will to bed,"
The Merchant of Venice,2,9,ARRAGON,10,I will ever be your head:
The Merchant of Venice,2,9,ARRAGON,11,So be gone: you are sped.
The Merchant of Venice,2,9,ARRAGON,12,Still more fool I shall appear
The Merchant of Venice,2,9,ARRAGON,13,By the time I linger here
The Merchant of Venice,2,9,ARRAGON,14,"With one fool's head I came to woo,"
The Merchant of Venice,2,9,ARRAGON,15,But I go away with two.
The Merchant of Venice,2,9,ARRAGON,16,"Sweet, adieu. I'll keep my oath,"
The Merchant of Venice,2,9,ARRAGON,17,Patiently to bear my wroth.
The Merchant of Venice,2,9,PORTIA,1,Thus hath the candle singed the moth.
The Merchant of Venice,2,9,PORTIA,2,"O, these deliberate fools! when they do choose,"
The Merchant of Venice,2,9,PORTIA,3,They have the wisdom by their wit to lose.
The Merchant of Venice,2,9,NERISSA,1,"The ancient saying is no heresy,"
The Merchant of Venice,2,9,NERISSA,2,Hanging and wiving goes by destiny.
The Merchant of Venice,2,9,PORTIA,1,"Come, draw the curtain, Nerissa."
The Merchant of Venice,2,9,SERVANT,1,Where is my lady?
The Merchant of Venice,2,9,PORTIA,1,Here: what would my lord?
The Merchant of Venice,2,9,SERVANT,1,"Madam, there is alighted at your gate"
The Merchant of Venice,2,9,SERVANT,2,"A young Venetian, one that comes before"
The Merchant of Venice,2,9,SERVANT,3,To signify the approaching of his lord;
The Merchant of Venice,2,9,SERVANT,4,"From whom he bringeth sensible regreets,"
The Merchant of Venice,2,9,SERVANT,5,"To wit, besides commends and courteous breath,"
The Merchant of Venice,2,9,SERVANT,6,Gifts of rich value. Yet I have not seen
The Merchant of Venice,2,9,SERVANT,7,So likely an ambassador of love:
The Merchant of Venice,2,9,SERVANT,8,"A day in April never came so sweet,"
The Merchant of Venice,2,9,SERVANT,9,"To show how costly summer was at hand,"
The Merchant of Venice,2,9,SERVANT,10,As this fore-spurrer comes before his lord.
The Merchant of Venice,2,9,PORTIA,1,"No more, I pray thee: I am half afeard"
The Merchant of Venice,2,9,PORTIA,2,"Thou wilt say anon he is some kin to thee,"
The Merchant of Venice,2,9,PORTIA,3,Thou spend'st such high-day wit in praising him.
The Merchant of Venice,2,9,PORTIA,4,"Come, come, Nerissa; for I long to see"
The Merchant of Venice,2,9,PORTIA,5,Quick Cupid's post that comes so mannerly.
The Merchant of Venice,2,9,NERISSA,1,"Bassanio, lord Love, if thy will it be!"
The Merchant of Venice,3,1,SALANIO,1,"Now, what news on the Rialto?"
The Merchant of Venice,3,1,SALARINO,1,"Why, yet it lives there uncheck'd that Antonio hath"
The Merchant of Venice,3,1,SALARINO,2,a ship of rich lading wrecked on the narrow seas;
The Merchant of Venice,3,1,SALARINO,3,"the Goodwins, I think they call the place; a very"
The Merchant of Venice,3,1,SALARINO,4,"dangerous flat and fatal, where the carcasses of many"
The Merchant of Venice,3,1,SALARINO,5,"a tall ship lie buried, as they say, if my gossip"
The Merchant of Venice,3,1,SALARINO,6,Report be an honest woman of her word.
The Merchant of Venice,3,1,SALANIO,1,I would she were as lying a gossip in that as ever
The Merchant of Venice,3,1,SALANIO,2,knapped ginger or made her neighbours believe she
The Merchant of Venice,3,1,SALANIO,3,wept for the death of a third husband. But it is
The Merchant of Venice,3,1,SALANIO,4,"true, without any slips of prolixity or crossing the"
The Merchant of Venice,3,1,SALANIO,5,"plain highway of talk, that the good Antonio, the"
The Merchant of Venice,3,1,SALANIO,6,"honest Antonio,--O that I had a title good enough"
The Merchant of Venice,3,1,SALANIO,7,to keep his name company!--
The Merchant of Venice,3,1,SALARINO,1,"Come, the full stop."
The Merchant of Venice,3,1,SALANIO,1,"Ha! what sayest thou? Why, the end is, he hath"
The Merchant of Venice,3,1,SALANIO,2,lost a ship.
The Merchant of Venice,3,1,SALARINO,1,I would it might prove the end of his losses.
The Merchant of Venice,3,1,SALANIO,1,"Let me say 'amen' betimes, lest the devil cross my"
The Merchant of Venice,3,1,SALANIO,2,"prayer, for here he comes in the likeness of a Jew."
The Merchant of Venice,3,1,SALANIO,3,"How now, Shylock! what news among the merchants?"
The Merchant of Venice,3,1,SHYLOCK,1,"You know, none so well, none so well as you, of my"
The Merchant of Venice,3,1,SHYLOCK,2,daughter's flight.
The Merchant of Venice,3,1,SALARINO,1,"That's certain: I, for my part, knew the tailor"
The Merchant of Venice,3,1,SALARINO,2,that made the wings she flew withal.
The Merchant of Venice,3,1,SALANIO,1,"And Shylock, for his own part, knew the bird was"
The Merchant of Venice,3,1,SALANIO,2,fledged; and then it is the complexion of them all
The Merchant of Venice,3,1,SALANIO,3,to leave the dam.
The Merchant of Venice,3,1,SHYLOCK,1,She is damned for it.
The Merchant of Venice,3,1,SALANIO,1,"That's certain, if the devil may be her judge."
The Merchant of Venice,3,1,SHYLOCK,1,My own flesh and blood to rebel!
The Merchant of Venice,3,1,SALANIO,1,"Out upon it, old carrion! rebels it at these years?"
The Merchant of Venice,3,1,SHYLOCK,1,"I say, my daughter is my flesh and blood."
The Merchant of Venice,3,1,SALARINO,1,There is more difference between thy flesh and hers
The Merchant of Venice,3,1,SALARINO,2,than between jet and ivory; more between your bloods
The Merchant of Venice,3,1,SALARINO,3,than there is between red wine and rhenish. But
The Merchant of Venice,3,1,SALARINO,4,"tell us, do you hear whether Antonio have had any"
The Merchant of Venice,3,1,SALARINO,5,loss at sea or no?
The Merchant of Venice,3,1,SHYLOCK,1,"There I have another bad match: a bankrupt, a"
The Merchant of Venice,3,1,SHYLOCK,2,"prodigal, who dare scarce show his head on the"
The Merchant of Venice,3,1,SHYLOCK,3,"Rialto; a beggar, that was used to come so smug upon"
The Merchant of Venice,3,1,SHYLOCK,4,the mart; let him look to his bond: he was wont to
The Merchant of Venice,3,1,SHYLOCK,5,call me usurer; let him look to his bond: he was
The Merchant of Venice,3,1,SHYLOCK,6,wont to lend money for a Christian courtesy; let him
The Merchant of Venice,3,1,SHYLOCK,7,look to his bond.
The Merchant of Venice,3,1,SALARINO,1,"Why, I am sure, if he forfeit, thou wilt not take"
The Merchant of Venice,3,1,SALARINO,2,his flesh: what's that good for?
The Merchant of Venice,3,1,SHYLOCK,1,"To bait fish withal: if it will feed nothing else,"
The Merchant of Venice,3,1,SHYLOCK,2,"it will feed my revenge. He hath disgraced me, and"
The Merchant of Venice,3,1,SHYLOCK,3,"hindered me half a million; laughed at my losses,"
The Merchant of Venice,3,1,SHYLOCK,4,"mocked at my gains, scorned my nation, thwarted my"
The Merchant of Venice,3,1,SHYLOCK,5,"bargains, cooled my friends, heated mine"
The Merchant of Venice,3,1,SHYLOCK,6,enemies; and what's his reason? I am a Jew. Hath
The Merchant of Venice,3,1,SHYLOCK,7,"not a Jew eyes? hath not a Jew hands, organs,"
The Merchant of Venice,3,1,SHYLOCK,8,"dimensions, senses, affections, passions? fed with"
The Merchant of Venice,3,1,SHYLOCK,9,"the same food, hurt with the same weapons, subject"
The Merchant of Venice,3,1,SHYLOCK,10,"to the same diseases, healed by the same means,"
The Merchant of Venice,3,1,SHYLOCK,11,"warmed and cooled by the same winter and summer, as"
The Merchant of Venice,3,1,SHYLOCK,12,"a Christian is? If you prick us, do we not bleed?"
The Merchant of Venice,3,1,SHYLOCK,13,"if you tickle us, do we not laugh? if you poison"
The Merchant of Venice,3,1,SHYLOCK,14,"us, do we not die? and if you wrong us, shall we not"
The Merchant of Venice,3,1,SHYLOCK,15,"revenge? If we are like you in the rest, we will"
The Merchant of Venice,3,1,SHYLOCK,16,"resemble you in that. If a Jew wrong a Christian,"
The Merchant of Venice,3,1,SHYLOCK,17,what is his humility? Revenge. If a Christian
The Merchant of Venice,3,1,SHYLOCK,18,"wrong a Jew, what should his sufferance be by"
The Merchant of Venice,3,1,SHYLOCK,19,"Christian example? Why, revenge. The villany you"
The Merchant of Venice,3,1,SHYLOCK,20,"teach me, I will execute, and it shall go hard but I"
The Merchant of Venice,3,1,SHYLOCK,21,will better the instruction.
The Merchant of Venice,3,1,SERVANT,1,"Gentlemen, my master Antonio is at his house and"
The Merchant of Venice,3,1,SERVANT,2,desires to speak with you both.
The Merchant of Venice,3,1,SALARINO,1,We have been up and down to seek him.
The Merchant of Venice,3,1,SALANIO,1,Here comes another of the tribe: a third cannot be
The Merchant of Venice,3,1,SALANIO,2,"matched, unless the devil himself turn Jew."
The Merchant of Venice,3,1,SHYLOCK,1,"How now, Tubal! what news from Genoa? hast thou"
The Merchant of Venice,3,1,SHYLOCK,2,found my daughter?
The Merchant of Venice,3,1,TUBAL,1,"I often came where I did hear of her, but cannot find her."
The Merchant of Venice,3,1,SHYLOCK,1,"Why, there, there, there, there! a diamond gone,"
The Merchant of Venice,3,1,SHYLOCK,2,cost me two thousand ducats in Frankfort! The curse
The Merchant of Venice,3,1,SHYLOCK,3,never fell upon our nation till now; I never felt it
The Merchant of Venice,3,1,SHYLOCK,4,till now: two thousand ducats in that; and other
The Merchant of Venice,3,1,SHYLOCK,5,"precious, precious jewels. I would my daughter"
The Merchant of Venice,3,1,SHYLOCK,6,"were dead at my foot, and the jewels in her ear!"
The Merchant of Venice,3,1,SHYLOCK,7,"would she were hearsed at my foot, and the ducats in"
The Merchant of Venice,3,1,SHYLOCK,8,"her coffin! No news of them? Why, so: and I know"
The Merchant of Venice,3,1,SHYLOCK,9,"not what's spent in the search: why, thou loss upon"
The Merchant of Venice,3,1,SHYLOCK,10,"loss! the thief gone with so much, and so much to"
The Merchant of Venice,3,1,SHYLOCK,11,"find the thief; and no satisfaction, no revenge:"
The Merchant of Venice,3,1,SHYLOCK,12,nor no in luck stirring but what lights on my
The Merchant of Venice,3,1,SHYLOCK,13,shoulders; no sighs but of my breathing; no tears
The Merchant of Venice,3,1,SHYLOCK,14,but of my shedding.
The Merchant of Venice,3,1,TUBAL,1,"Yes, other men have ill luck too: Antonio, as I"
The Merchant of Venice,3,1,TUBAL,2,"heard in Genoa,--"
The Merchant of Venice,3,1,SHYLOCK,1,"What, what, what? ill luck, ill luck?"
The Merchant of Venice,3,1,TUBAL,1,"Hath an argosy cast away, coming from Tripolis."
The Merchant of Venice,3,1,SHYLOCK,1,"I thank God, I thank God. Is't true, is't true?"
The Merchant of Venice,3,1,TUBAL,1,I spoke with some of the sailors that escaped the wreck.
The Merchant of Venice,3,1,SHYLOCK,1,"I thank thee, good Tubal: good news, good news!"
The Merchant of Venice,3,1,SHYLOCK,2,"ha, ha! where? in Genoa?"
The Merchant of Venice,3,1,TUBAL,1,"Your daughter spent in Genoa, as I heard, in one"
The Merchant of Venice,3,1,TUBAL,2,night fourscore ducats.
The Merchant of Venice,3,1,SHYLOCK,1,Thou stickest a dagger in me: I shall never see my
The Merchant of Venice,3,1,SHYLOCK,2,gold again: fourscore ducats at a sitting!
The Merchant of Venice,3,1,SHYLOCK,3,fourscore ducats!
The Merchant of Venice,3,1,TUBAL,1,There came divers of Antonio's creditors in my
The Merchant of Venice,3,1,TUBAL,2,"company to Venice, that swear he cannot choose but break."
The Merchant of Venice,3,1,SHYLOCK,1,I am very glad of it: I'll plague him; I'll torture
The Merchant of Venice,3,1,SHYLOCK,2,him: I am glad of it.
The Merchant of Venice,3,1,TUBAL,1,One of them showed me a ring that he had of your
The Merchant of Venice,3,1,TUBAL,2,daughter for a monkey.
The Merchant of Venice,3,1,SHYLOCK,1,"Out upon her! Thou torturest me, Tubal: it was my"
The Merchant of Venice,3,1,SHYLOCK,2,turquoise; I had it of Leah when I was a bachelor:
The Merchant of Venice,3,1,SHYLOCK,3,I would not have given it for a wilderness of monkeys.
The Merchant of Venice,3,1,TUBAL,1,But Antonio is certainly undone.
The Merchant of Venice,3,1,SHYLOCK,1,"Nay, that's true, that's very true. Go, Tubal, fee"
The Merchant of Venice,3,1,SHYLOCK,2,me an officer; bespeak him a fortnight before. I
The Merchant of Venice,3,1,SHYLOCK,3,"will have the heart of him, if he forfeit; for, were"
The Merchant of Venice,3,1,SHYLOCK,4,"he out of Venice, I can make what merchandise I"
The Merchant of Venice,3,1,SHYLOCK,5,"will. Go, go, Tubal, and meet me at our synagogue;"
The Merchant of Venice,3,1,SHYLOCK,6,"go, good Tubal; at our synagogue, Tubal."
The Merchant of Venice,3,2,PORTIA,1,"I pray you, tarry: pause a day or two"
The Merchant of Venice,3,2,PORTIA,2,"Before you hazard; for, in choosing wrong,"
The Merchant of Venice,3,2,PORTIA,3,I lose your company: therefore forbear awhile.
The Merchant of Venice,3,2,PORTIA,4,"There's something tells me, but it is not love,"
The Merchant of Venice,3,2,PORTIA,5,"I would not lose you; and you know yourself,"
The Merchant of Venice,3,2,PORTIA,6,Hate counsels not in such a quality.
The Merchant of Venice,3,2,PORTIA,7,"But lest you should not understand me well,--"
The Merchant of Venice,3,2,PORTIA,8,"And yet a maiden hath no tongue but thought,--"
The Merchant of Venice,3,2,PORTIA,9,I would detain you here some month or two
The Merchant of Venice,3,2,PORTIA,10,Before you venture for me. I could teach you
The Merchant of Venice,3,2,PORTIA,11,"How to choose right, but I am then forsworn;"
The Merchant of Venice,3,2,PORTIA,12,So will I never be: so may you miss me;
The Merchant of Venice,3,2,PORTIA,13,"But if you do, you'll make me wish a sin,"
The Merchant of Venice,3,2,PORTIA,14,"That I had been forsworn. Beshrew your eyes,"
The Merchant of Venice,3,2,PORTIA,15,They have o'erlook'd me and divided me;
The Merchant of Venice,3,2,PORTIA,16,"One half of me is yours, the other half yours,"
The Merchant of Venice,3,2,PORTIA,17,"Mine own, I would say; but if mine, then yours,"
The Merchant of Venice,3,2,PORTIA,18,"And so all yours. O, these naughty times"
The Merchant of Venice,3,2,PORTIA,19,Put bars between the owners and their rights!
The Merchant of Venice,3,2,PORTIA,20,"And so, though yours, not yours. Prove it so,"
The Merchant of Venice,3,2,PORTIA,21,"Let fortune go to hell for it, not I."
The Merchant of Venice,3,2,PORTIA,22,"I speak too long; but 'tis to peize the time,"
The Merchant of Venice,3,2,PORTIA,23,"To eke it and to draw it out in length,"
The Merchant of Venice,3,2,PORTIA,24,To stay you from election.
The Merchant of Venice,3,2,BASSANIO,1,Let me choose
The Merchant of Venice,3,2,BASSANIO,2,"For as I am, I live upon the rack."
The Merchant of Venice,3,2,PORTIA,1,"Upon the rack, Bassanio! then confess"
The Merchant of Venice,3,2,PORTIA,2,What treason there is mingled with your love.
The Merchant of Venice,3,2,BASSANIO,1,"None but that ugly treason of mistrust,"
The Merchant of Venice,3,2,BASSANIO,2,Which makes me fear the enjoying of my love:
The Merchant of Venice,3,2,BASSANIO,3,There may as well be amity and life
The Merchant of Venice,3,2,BASSANIO,4,"'Tween snow and fire, as treason and my love."
The Merchant of Venice,3,2,PORTIA,1,"Ay, but I fear you speak upon the rack,"
The Merchant of Venice,3,2,PORTIA,2,Where men enforced do speak anything.
The Merchant of Venice,3,2,BASSANIO,1,"Promise me life, and I'll confess the truth."
The Merchant of Venice,3,2,PORTIA,1,"Well then, confess and live."
The Merchant of Venice,3,2,BASSANIO,1,'Confess' and 'love'
The Merchant of Venice,3,2,BASSANIO,2,Had been the very sum of my confession:
The Merchant of Venice,3,2,BASSANIO,3,"O happy torment, when my torturer"
The Merchant of Venice,3,2,BASSANIO,4,Doth teach me answers for deliverance!
The Merchant of Venice,3,2,BASSANIO,5,But let me to my fortune and the caskets.
The Merchant of Venice,3,2,PORTIA,1,"Away, then! I am lock'd in one of them:"
The Merchant of Venice,3,2,PORTIA,2,"If you do love me, you will find me out."
The Merchant of Venice,3,2,PORTIA,3,"Nerissa and the rest, stand all aloof."
The Merchant of Venice,3,2,PORTIA,4,Let music sound while he doth make his choice;
The Merchant of Venice,3,2,PORTIA,5,"Then, if he lose, he makes a swan-like end,"
The Merchant of Venice,3,2,PORTIA,6,Fading in music: that the comparison
The Merchant of Venice,3,2,PORTIA,7,"May stand more proper, my eye shall be the stream"
The Merchant of Venice,3,2,PORTIA,8,And watery death-bed for him. He may win;
The Merchant of Venice,3,2,PORTIA,9,And what is music then? Then music is
The Merchant of Venice,3,2,PORTIA,10,Even as the flourish when true subjects bow
The Merchant of Venice,3,2,PORTIA,11,To a new-crowned monarch: such it is
The Merchant of Venice,3,2,PORTIA,12,As are those dulcet sounds in break of day
The Merchant of Venice,3,2,PORTIA,13,"That creep into the dreaming bridegroom's ear,"
The Merchant of Venice,3,2,PORTIA,14,"And summon him to marriage. Now he goes,"
The Merchant of Venice,3,2,PORTIA,15,"With no less presence, but with much more love,"
The Merchant of Venice,3,2,PORTIA,16,"Than young Alcides, when he did redeem"
The Merchant of Venice,3,2,PORTIA,17,The virgin tribute paid by howling Troy
The Merchant of Venice,3,2,PORTIA,18,To the sea-monster: I stand for sacrifice
The Merchant of Venice,3,2,PORTIA,19,"The rest aloof are the Dardanian wives,"
The Merchant of Venice,3,2,PORTIA,20,"With bleared visages, come forth to view"
The Merchant of Venice,3,2,PORTIA,21,"The issue of the exploit. Go, Hercules!"
The Merchant of Venice,3,2,PORTIA,22,"Live thou, I live: with much, much more dismay"
The Merchant of Venice,3,2,PORTIA,23,I view the fight than thou that makest the fray.
The Merchant of Venice,3,2,PORTIA,24,"Tell me where is fancy bred,"
The Merchant of Venice,3,2,PORTIA,25,"Or in the heart, or in the head?"
The Merchant of Venice,3,2,PORTIA,26,"How begot, how nourished?"
The Merchant of Venice,3,2,PORTIA,27,"Reply, reply."
The Merchant of Venice,3,2,PORTIA,28,"It is engender'd in the eyes,"
The Merchant of Venice,3,2,PORTIA,29,With gazing fed; and fancy dies
The Merchant of Venice,3,2,PORTIA,30,In the cradle where it lies.
The Merchant of Venice,3,2,PORTIA,31,Let us all ring fancy's knell
The Merchant of Venice,3,2,PORTIA,32,"I'll begin it,--Ding, dong, bell."
The Merchant of Venice,3,2,ALL,1,"Ding, dong, bell."
The Merchant of Venice,3,2,BASSANIO,1,So may the outward shows be least themselves:
The Merchant of Venice,3,2,BASSANIO,2,The world is still deceived with ornament.
The Merchant of Venice,3,2,BASSANIO,3,"In law, what plea so tainted and corrupt,"
The Merchant of Venice,3,2,BASSANIO,4,"But, being seasoned with a gracious voice,"
The Merchant of Venice,3,2,BASSANIO,5,"Obscures the show of evil? In religion,"
The Merchant of Venice,3,2,BASSANIO,6,"What damned error, but some sober brow"
The Merchant of Venice,3,2,BASSANIO,7,"Will bless it and approve it with a text,"
The Merchant of Venice,3,2,BASSANIO,8,Hiding the grossness with fair ornament?
The Merchant of Venice,3,2,BASSANIO,9,There is no vice so simple but assumes
The Merchant of Venice,3,2,BASSANIO,10,Some mark of virtue on his outward parts:
The Merchant of Venice,3,2,BASSANIO,11,"How many cowards, whose hearts are all as false"
The Merchant of Venice,3,2,BASSANIO,12,"As stairs of sand, wear yet upon their chins"
The Merchant of Venice,3,2,BASSANIO,13,The beards of Hercules and frowning Mars;
The Merchant of Venice,3,2,BASSANIO,14,"Who, inward search'd, have livers white as milk;"
The Merchant of Venice,3,2,BASSANIO,15,And these assume but valour's excrement
The Merchant of Venice,3,2,BASSANIO,16,"To render them redoubted! Look on beauty,"
The Merchant of Venice,3,2,BASSANIO,17,And you shall see 'tis purchased by the weight;
The Merchant of Venice,3,2,BASSANIO,18,"Which therein works a miracle in nature,"
The Merchant of Venice,3,2,BASSANIO,19,Making them lightest that wear most of it:
The Merchant of Venice,3,2,BASSANIO,20,So are those crisped snaky golden locks
The Merchant of Venice,3,2,BASSANIO,21,"Which make such wanton gambols with the wind,"
The Merchant of Venice,3,2,BASSANIO,22,"Upon supposed fairness, often known"
The Merchant of Venice,3,2,BASSANIO,23,"To be the dowry of a second head,"
The Merchant of Venice,3,2,BASSANIO,24,The skull that bred them in the sepulchre.
The Merchant of Venice,3,2,BASSANIO,25,Thus ornament is but the guiled shore
The Merchant of Venice,3,2,BASSANIO,26,To a most dangerous sea; the beauteous scarf
The Merchant of Venice,3,2,BASSANIO,27,"Veiling an Indian beauty; in a word,"
The Merchant of Venice,3,2,BASSANIO,28,The seeming truth which cunning times put on
The Merchant of Venice,3,2,BASSANIO,29,"To entrap the wisest. Therefore, thou gaudy gold,"
The Merchant of Venice,3,2,BASSANIO,30,"Hard food for Midas, I will none of thee;"
The Merchant of Venice,3,2,BASSANIO,31,"Nor none of thee, thou pale and common drudge"
The Merchant of Venice,3,2,BASSANIO,32,"'Tween man and man: but thou, thou meagre lead,"
The Merchant of Venice,3,2,BASSANIO,33,"Which rather threatenest than dost promise aught,"
The Merchant of Venice,3,2,BASSANIO,34,Thy paleness moves me more than eloquence;
The Merchant of Venice,3,2,BASSANIO,35,And here choose I; joy be the consequence!
The Merchant of Venice,3,2,PORTIA,1,"As doubtful thoughts, and rash-embraced despair,"
The Merchant of Venice,3,2,PORTIA,2,"And shuddering fear, and green-eyed jealousy! O love,"
The Merchant of Venice,3,2,PORTIA,3,"Be moderate; allay thy ecstasy,"
The Merchant of Venice,3,2,PORTIA,4,In measure rein thy joy; scant this excess.
The Merchant of Venice,3,2,PORTIA,5,"I feel too much thy blessing: make it less,"
The Merchant of Venice,3,2,PORTIA,6,For fear I surfeit.
The Merchant of Venice,3,2,BASSANIO,1,What find I here?
The Merchant of Venice,3,2,BASSANIO,2,Fair Portia's counterfeit! What demi-god
The Merchant of Venice,3,2,BASSANIO,3,Hath come so near creation? Move these eyes?
The Merchant of Venice,3,2,BASSANIO,4,"Or whether, riding on the balls of mine,"
The Merchant of Venice,3,2,BASSANIO,5,"Seem they in motion? Here are sever'd lips,"
The Merchant of Venice,3,2,BASSANIO,6,Parted with sugar breath: so sweet a bar
The Merchant of Venice,3,2,BASSANIO,7,Should sunder such sweet friends. Here in her hairs
The Merchant of Venice,3,2,BASSANIO,8,The painter plays the spider and hath woven
The Merchant of Venice,3,2,BASSANIO,9,"A golden mesh to entrap the hearts of men,"
The Merchant of Venice,3,2,BASSANIO,10,"Faster than gnats in cobwebs; but her eyes,--"
The Merchant of Venice,3,2,BASSANIO,11,"How could he see to do them? having made one,"
The Merchant of Venice,3,2,BASSANIO,12,Methinks it should have power to steal both his
The Merchant of Venice,3,2,BASSANIO,13,"And leave itself unfurnish'd. Yet look, how far"
The Merchant of Venice,3,2,BASSANIO,14,The substance of my praise doth wrong this shadow
The Merchant of Venice,3,2,BASSANIO,15,"In underprizing it, so far this shadow"
The Merchant of Venice,3,2,BASSANIO,16,"Doth limp behind the substance. Here's the scroll,"
The Merchant of Venice,3,2,BASSANIO,17,The continent and summary of my fortune.
The Merchant of Venice,3,2,BASSANIO,18,"You that choose not by the view,"
The Merchant of Venice,3,2,BASSANIO,19,Chance as fair and choose as true!
The Merchant of Venice,3,2,BASSANIO,20,"Since this fortune falls to you,"
The Merchant of Venice,3,2,BASSANIO,21,"Be content and seek no new,"
The Merchant of Venice,3,2,BASSANIO,22,If you be well pleased with this
The Merchant of Venice,3,2,BASSANIO,23,"And hold your fortune for your bliss,"
The Merchant of Venice,3,2,BASSANIO,24,Turn you where your lady is
The Merchant of Venice,3,2,BASSANIO,25,And claim her with a loving kiss.
The Merchant of Venice,3,2,BASSANIO,26,"A gentle scroll. Fair lady, by your leave;"
The Merchant of Venice,3,2,BASSANIO,27,"I come by note, to give and to receive."
The Merchant of Venice,3,2,BASSANIO,28,"Like one of two contending in a prize,"
The Merchant of Venice,3,2,BASSANIO,29,"That thinks he hath done well in people's eyes,"
The Merchant of Venice,3,2,BASSANIO,30,"Hearing applause and universal shout,"
The Merchant of Venice,3,2,BASSANIO,31,"Giddy in spirit, still gazing in a doubt"
The Merchant of Venice,3,2,BASSANIO,32,Whether these pearls of praise be his or no;
The Merchant of Venice,3,2,BASSANIO,33,"So, thrice fair lady, stand I, even so;"
The Merchant of Venice,3,2,BASSANIO,34,"As doubtful whether what I see be true,"
The Merchant of Venice,3,2,BASSANIO,35,"Until confirm'd, sign'd, ratified by you."
The Merchant of Venice,3,2,PORTIA,1,"You see me, Lord Bassanio, where I stand,"
The Merchant of Venice,3,2,PORTIA,2,Such as I am: though for myself alone
The Merchant of Venice,3,2,PORTIA,3,"I would not be ambitious in my wish,"
The Merchant of Venice,3,2,PORTIA,4,"To wish myself much better; yet, for you"
The Merchant of Venice,3,2,PORTIA,5,I would be trebled twenty times myself;
The Merchant of Venice,3,2,PORTIA,6,"A thousand times more fair, ten thousand times more rich;"
The Merchant of Venice,3,2,PORTIA,7,"That only to stand high in your account,"
The Merchant of Venice,3,2,PORTIA,8,"I might in virtue, beauties, livings, friends,"
The Merchant of Venice,3,2,PORTIA,9,Exceed account; but the full sum of me
The Merchant of Venice,3,2,PORTIA,10,"Is sum of something, which, to term in gross,"
The Merchant of Venice,3,2,PORTIA,11,"Is an unlesson'd girl, unschool'd, unpractised;"
The Merchant of Venice,3,2,PORTIA,12,"Happy in this, she is not yet so old"
The Merchant of Venice,3,2,PORTIA,13,"But she may learn; happier than this,"
The Merchant of Venice,3,2,PORTIA,14,She is not bred so dull but she can learn;
The Merchant of Venice,3,2,PORTIA,15,Happiest of all is that her gentle spirit
The Merchant of Venice,3,2,PORTIA,16,"Commits itself to yours to be directed,"
The Merchant of Venice,3,2,PORTIA,17,"As from her lord, her governor, her king."
The Merchant of Venice,3,2,PORTIA,18,Myself and what is mine to you and yours
The Merchant of Venice,3,2,PORTIA,19,Is now converted: but now I was the lord
The Merchant of Venice,3,2,PORTIA,20,"Of this fair mansion, master of my servants,"
The Merchant of Venice,3,2,PORTIA,21,"Queen o'er myself: and even now, but now,"
The Merchant of Venice,3,2,PORTIA,22,"This house, these servants and this same myself"
The Merchant of Venice,3,2,PORTIA,23,"Are yours, my lord: I give them with this ring;"
The Merchant of Venice,3,2,PORTIA,24,"Which when you part from, lose, or give away,"
The Merchant of Venice,3,2,PORTIA,25,Let it presage the ruin of your love
The Merchant of Venice,3,2,PORTIA,26,And be my vantage to exclaim on you.
The Merchant of Venice,3,2,BASSANIO,1,"Madam, you have bereft me of all words,"
The Merchant of Venice,3,2,BASSANIO,2,Only my blood speaks to you in my veins;
The Merchant of Venice,3,2,BASSANIO,3,"And there is such confusion in my powers,"
The Merchant of Venice,3,2,BASSANIO,4,As after some oration fairly spoke
The Merchant of Venice,3,2,BASSANIO,5,"By a beloved prince, there doth appear"
The Merchant of Venice,3,2,BASSANIO,6,Among the buzzing pleased multitude;
The Merchant of Venice,3,2,BASSANIO,7,"Where every something, being blent together,"
The Merchant of Venice,3,2,BASSANIO,8,"Turns to a wild of nothing, save of joy,"
The Merchant of Venice,3,2,BASSANIO,9,Express'd and not express'd. But when this ring
The Merchant of Venice,3,2,BASSANIO,10,"Parts from this finger, then parts life from hence:"
The Merchant of Venice,3,2,BASSANIO,11,"O, then be bold to say Bassanio's dead!"
The Merchant of Venice,3,2,NERISSA,1,"My lord and lady, it is now our time,"
The Merchant of Venice,3,2,NERISSA,2,"That have stood by and seen our wishes prosper,"
The Merchant of Venice,3,2,NERISSA,3,"To cry, good joy: good joy, my lord and lady!"
The Merchant of Venice,3,2,GRATIANO,1,"My lord Bassanio and my gentle lady,"
The Merchant of Venice,3,2,GRATIANO,2,I wish you all the joy that you can wish;
The Merchant of Venice,3,2,GRATIANO,3,For I am sure you can wish none from me:
The Merchant of Venice,3,2,GRATIANO,4,And when your honours mean to solemnize
The Merchant of Venice,3,2,GRATIANO,5,"The bargain of your faith, I do beseech you,"
The Merchant of Venice,3,2,GRATIANO,6,Even at that time I may be married too.
The Merchant of Venice,3,2,BASSANIO,1,"With all my heart, so thou canst get a wife."
The Merchant of Venice,3,2,GRATIANO,1,"I thank your lordship, you have got me one."
The Merchant of Venice,3,2,GRATIANO,2,"My eyes, my lord, can look as swift as yours:"
The Merchant of Venice,3,2,GRATIANO,3,"You saw the mistress, I beheld the maid;"
The Merchant of Venice,3,2,GRATIANO,4,"You loved, I loved for intermission."
The Merchant of Venice,3,2,GRATIANO,5,"No more pertains to me, my lord, than you."
The Merchant of Venice,3,2,GRATIANO,6,"Your fortune stood upon the casket there,"
The Merchant of Venice,3,2,GRATIANO,7,"And so did mine too, as the matter falls;"
The Merchant of Venice,3,2,GRATIANO,8,"For wooing here until I sweat again,"
The Merchant of Venice,3,2,GRATIANO,9,And sweating until my very roof was dry
The Merchant of Venice,3,2,GRATIANO,10,"With oaths of love, at last, if promise last,"
The Merchant of Venice,3,2,GRATIANO,11,I got a promise of this fair one here
The Merchant of Venice,3,2,GRATIANO,12,"To have her love, provided that your fortune"
The Merchant of Venice,3,2,GRATIANO,13,Achieved her mistress.
The Merchant of Venice,3,2,PORTIA,1,"Is this true, Nerissa?"
The Merchant of Venice,3,2,NERISSA,1,"Madam, it is, so you stand pleased withal."
The Merchant of Venice,3,2,BASSANIO,1,"And do you, Gratiano, mean good faith?"
The Merchant of Venice,3,2,GRATIANO,1,"Yes, faith, my lord."
The Merchant of Venice,3,2,BASSANIO,1,Our feast shall be much honour'd in your marriage.
The Merchant of Venice,3,2,GRATIANO,1,We'll play with them the first boy for a thousand ducats.
The Merchant of Venice,3,2,NERISSA,1,"What, and stake down?"
The Merchant of Venice,3,2,GRATIANO,1,"No; we shall ne'er win at that sport, and stake down."
The Merchant of Venice,3,2,GRATIANO,2,"But who comes here? Lorenzo and his infidel? What,"
The Merchant of Venice,3,2,GRATIANO,3,and my old Venetian friend Salerio?
The Merchant of Venice,3,2,BASSANIO,1,"Lorenzo and Salerio, welcome hither;"
The Merchant of Venice,3,2,BASSANIO,2,If that the youth of my new interest here
The Merchant of Venice,3,2,BASSANIO,3,"Have power to bid you welcome. By your leave,"
The Merchant of Venice,3,2,BASSANIO,4,"I bid my very friends and countrymen,"
The Merchant of Venice,3,2,BASSANIO,5,"Sweet Portia, welcome."
The Merchant of Venice,3,2,PORTIA,1,"So do I, my lord:"
The Merchant of Venice,3,2,PORTIA,2,They are entirely welcome.
The Merchant of Venice,3,2,LORENZO,1,"I thank your honour. For my part, my lord,"
The Merchant of Venice,3,2,LORENZO,2,My purpose was not to have seen you here;
The Merchant of Venice,3,2,LORENZO,3,"But meeting with Salerio by the way,"
The Merchant of Venice,3,2,LORENZO,4,"He did entreat me, past all saying nay,"
The Merchant of Venice,3,2,LORENZO,5,To come with him along.
The Merchant of Venice,3,2,SALERIO,1,"I did, my lord;"
The Merchant of Venice,3,2,SALERIO,2,And I have reason for it. Signior Antonio
The Merchant of Venice,3,2,SALERIO,3,Commends him to you.
The Merchant of Venice,3,2,BASSANIO,1,"Ere I ope his letter,"
The Merchant of Venice,3,2,BASSANIO,2,"I pray you, tell me how my good friend doth."
The Merchant of Venice,3,2,SALERIO,1,"Not sick, my lord, unless it be in mind;"
The Merchant of Venice,3,2,SALERIO,2,"Nor well, unless in mind: his letter there"
The Merchant of Venice,3,2,SALERIO,3,Will show you his estate.
The Merchant of Venice,3,2,GRATIANO,1,"Nerissa, cheer yon stranger; bid her welcome."
The Merchant of Venice,3,2,GRATIANO,2,"Your hand, Salerio: what's the news from Venice?"
The Merchant of Venice,3,2,GRATIANO,3,"How doth that royal merchant, good Antonio?"
The Merchant of Venice,3,2,GRATIANO,4,I know he will be glad of our success;
The Merchant of Venice,3,2,GRATIANO,5,"We are the Jasons, we have won the fleece."
The Merchant of Venice,3,2,SALERIO,1,I would you had won the fleece that he hath lost.
The Merchant of Venice,3,2,PORTIA,1,"There are some shrewd contents in yon same paper,"
The Merchant of Venice,3,2,PORTIA,2,That steals the colour from Bassanio's cheek:
The Merchant of Venice,3,2,PORTIA,3,Some dear friend dead; else nothing in the world
The Merchant of Venice,3,2,PORTIA,4,Could turn so much the constitution
The Merchant of Venice,3,2,PORTIA,5,"Of any constant man. What, worse and worse!"
The Merchant of Venice,3,2,PORTIA,6,"With leave, Bassanio: I am half yourself,"
The Merchant of Venice,3,2,PORTIA,7,And I must freely have the half of anything
The Merchant of Venice,3,2,PORTIA,8,That this same paper brings you.
The Merchant of Venice,3,2,BASSANIO,1,"O sweet Portia,"
The Merchant of Venice,3,2,BASSANIO,2,Here are a few of the unpleasant'st words
The Merchant of Venice,3,2,BASSANIO,3,"That ever blotted paper! Gentle lady,"
The Merchant of Venice,3,2,BASSANIO,4,"When I did first impart my love to you,"
The Merchant of Venice,3,2,BASSANIO,5,"I freely told you, all the wealth I had"
The Merchant of Venice,3,2,BASSANIO,6,"Ran in my veins, I was a gentleman;"
The Merchant of Venice,3,2,BASSANIO,7,"And then I told you true: and yet, dear lady,"
The Merchant of Venice,3,2,BASSANIO,8,"Rating myself at nothing, you shall see"
The Merchant of Venice,3,2,BASSANIO,9,How much I was a braggart. When I told you
The Merchant of Venice,3,2,BASSANIO,10,"My state was nothing, I should then have told you"
The Merchant of Venice,3,2,BASSANIO,11,"That I was worse than nothing; for, indeed,"
The Merchant of Venice,3,2,BASSANIO,12,"I have engaged myself to a dear friend,"
The Merchant of Venice,3,2,BASSANIO,13,"Engaged my friend to his mere enemy,"
The Merchant of Venice,3,2,BASSANIO,14,"To feed my means. Here is a letter, lady;"
The Merchant of Venice,3,2,BASSANIO,15,"The paper as the body of my friend,"
The Merchant of Venice,3,2,BASSANIO,16,"And every word in it a gaping wound,"
The Merchant of Venice,3,2,BASSANIO,17,"Issuing life-blood. But is it true, Salerio?"
The Merchant of Venice,3,2,BASSANIO,18,"Have all his ventures fail'd? What, not one hit?"
The Merchant of Venice,3,2,BASSANIO,19,"From Tripolis, from Mexico and England,"
The Merchant of Venice,3,2,BASSANIO,20,"From Lisbon, Barbary and India?"
The Merchant of Venice,3,2,BASSANIO,21,And not one vessel 'scape the dreadful touch
The Merchant of Venice,3,2,BASSANIO,22,Of merchant-marring rocks?
The Merchant of Venice,3,2,SALERIO,1,"Not one, my lord."
The Merchant of Venice,3,2,SALERIO,2,"Besides, it should appear, that if he had"
The Merchant of Venice,3,2,SALERIO,3,"The present money to discharge the Jew,"
The Merchant of Venice,3,2,SALERIO,4,He would not take it. Never did I know
The Merchant of Venice,3,2,SALERIO,5,"A creature, that did bear the shape of man,"
The Merchant of Venice,3,2,SALERIO,6,So keen and greedy to confound a man:
The Merchant of Venice,3,2,SALERIO,7,"He plies the duke at morning and at night,"
The Merchant of Venice,3,2,SALERIO,8,"And doth impeach the freedom of the state,"
The Merchant of Venice,3,2,SALERIO,9,"If they deny him justice: twenty merchants,"
The Merchant of Venice,3,2,SALERIO,10,"The duke himself, and the magnificoes"
The Merchant of Venice,3,2,SALERIO,11,"Of greatest port, have all persuaded with him;"
The Merchant of Venice,3,2,SALERIO,12,But none can drive him from the envious plea
The Merchant of Venice,3,2,SALERIO,13,"Of forfeiture, of justice and his bond."
The Merchant of Venice,3,2,JESSICA,1,When I was with him I have heard him swear
The Merchant of Venice,3,2,JESSICA,2,"To Tubal and to Chus, his countrymen,"
The Merchant of Venice,3,2,JESSICA,3,That he would rather have Antonio's flesh
The Merchant of Venice,3,2,JESSICA,4,Than twenty times the value of the sum
The Merchant of Venice,3,2,JESSICA,5,"That he did owe him: and I know, my lord,"
The Merchant of Venice,3,2,JESSICA,6,"If law, authority and power deny not,"
The Merchant of Venice,3,2,JESSICA,7,It will go hard with poor Antonio.
The Merchant of Venice,3,2,PORTIA,1,Is it your dear friend that is thus in trouble?
The Merchant of Venice,3,2,BASSANIO,1,"The dearest friend to me, the kindest man,"
The Merchant of Venice,3,2,BASSANIO,2,The best-condition'd and unwearied spirit
The Merchant of Venice,3,2,BASSANIO,3,"In doing courtesies, and one in whom"
The Merchant of Venice,3,2,BASSANIO,4,The ancient Roman honour more appears
The Merchant of Venice,3,2,BASSANIO,5,Than any that draws breath in Italy.
The Merchant of Venice,3,2,PORTIA,1,What sum owes he the Jew?
The Merchant of Venice,3,2,BASSANIO,1,For me three thousand ducats.
The Merchant of Venice,3,2,PORTIA,1,"What, no more?"
The Merchant of Venice,3,2,PORTIA,2,"Pay him six thousand, and deface the bond;"
The Merchant of Venice,3,2,PORTIA,3,"Double six thousand, and then treble that,"
The Merchant of Venice,3,2,PORTIA,4,Before a friend of this description
The Merchant of Venice,3,2,PORTIA,5,Shall lose a hair through Bassanio's fault.
The Merchant of Venice,3,2,PORTIA,6,"First go with me to church and call me wife,"
The Merchant of Venice,3,2,PORTIA,7,And then away to Venice to your friend;
The Merchant of Venice,3,2,PORTIA,8,For never shall you lie by Portia's side
The Merchant of Venice,3,2,PORTIA,9,With an unquiet soul. You shall have gold
The Merchant of Venice,3,2,PORTIA,10,To pay the petty debt twenty times over:
The Merchant of Venice,3,2,PORTIA,11,"When it is paid, bring your true friend along."
The Merchant of Venice,3,2,PORTIA,12,My maid Nerissa and myself meantime
The Merchant of Venice,3,2,PORTIA,13,"Will live as maids and widows. Come, away!"
The Merchant of Venice,3,2,PORTIA,14,For you shall hence upon your wedding-day:
The Merchant of Venice,3,2,PORTIA,15,"Bid your friends welcome, show a merry cheer:"
The Merchant of Venice,3,2,PORTIA,16,"Since you are dear bought, I will love you dear."
The Merchant of Venice,3,2,PORTIA,17,But let me hear the letter of your friend.
The Merchant of Venice,3,2,BASSANIO,1,"miscarried, my creditors grow cruel, my estate is"
The Merchant of Venice,3,2,BASSANIO,2,"very low, my bond to the Jew is forfeit; and since"
The Merchant of Venice,3,2,BASSANIO,3,"in paying it, it is impossible I should live, all"
The Merchant of Venice,3,2,BASSANIO,4,"debts are cleared between you and I, if I might but"
The Merchant of Venice,3,2,BASSANIO,5,"see you at my death. Notwithstanding, use your"
The Merchant of Venice,3,2,BASSANIO,6,"pleasure: if your love do not persuade you to come,"
The Merchant of Venice,3,2,BASSANIO,7,let not my letter.
The Merchant of Venice,3,2,PORTIA,1,"O love, dispatch all business, and be gone!"
The Merchant of Venice,3,2,BASSANIO,1,"Since I have your good leave to go away,"
The Merchant of Venice,3,2,BASSANIO,2,"I will make haste: but, till I come again,"
The Merchant of Venice,3,2,BASSANIO,3,"No bed shall e'er be guilty of my stay,"
The Merchant of Venice,3,2,BASSANIO,4,No rest be interposer 'twixt us twain.
The Merchant of Venice,3,3,SHYLOCK,1,"Gaoler, look to him: tell not me of mercy;"
The Merchant of Venice,3,3,SHYLOCK,2,This is the fool that lent out money gratis:
The Merchant of Venice,3,3,SHYLOCK,3,"Gaoler, look to him."
The Merchant of Venice,3,3,ANTONIO,1,"Hear me yet, good Shylock."
The Merchant of Venice,3,3,SHYLOCK,1,I'll have my bond; speak not against my bond:
The Merchant of Venice,3,3,SHYLOCK,2,I have sworn an oath that I will have my bond.
The Merchant of Venice,3,3,SHYLOCK,3,Thou call'dst me dog before thou hadst a cause;
The Merchant of Venice,3,3,SHYLOCK,4,"But, since I am a dog, beware my fangs:"
The Merchant of Venice,3,3,SHYLOCK,5,"The duke shall grant me justice. I do wonder,"
The Merchant of Venice,3,3,SHYLOCK,6,"Thou naughty gaoler, that thou art so fond"
The Merchant of Venice,3,3,SHYLOCK,7,To come abroad with him at his request.
The Merchant of Venice,3,3,ANTONIO,1,"I pray thee, hear me speak."
The Merchant of Venice,3,3,SHYLOCK,1,I'll have my bond; I will not hear thee speak:
The Merchant of Venice,3,3,SHYLOCK,2,I'll have my bond; and therefore speak no more.
The Merchant of Venice,3,3,SHYLOCK,3,"I'll not be made a soft and dull-eyed fool,"
The Merchant of Venice,3,3,SHYLOCK,4,"To shake the head, relent, and sigh, and yield"
The Merchant of Venice,3,3,SHYLOCK,5,To Christian intercessors. Follow not;
The Merchant of Venice,3,3,SHYLOCK,6,I'll have no speaking: I will have my bond.
The Merchant of Venice,3,3,SALARINO,1,It is the most impenetrable cur
The Merchant of Venice,3,3,SALARINO,2,That ever kept with men.
The Merchant of Venice,3,3,ANTONIO,1,Let him alone:
The Merchant of Venice,3,3,ANTONIO,2,I'll follow him no more with bootless prayers.
The Merchant of Venice,3,3,ANTONIO,3,He seeks my life; his reason well I know:
The Merchant of Venice,3,3,ANTONIO,4,I oft deliver'd from his forfeitures
The Merchant of Venice,3,3,ANTONIO,5,Many that have at times made moan to me;
The Merchant of Venice,3,3,ANTONIO,6,Therefore he hates me.
The Merchant of Venice,3,3,SALARINO,1,I am sure the duke
The Merchant of Venice,3,3,SALARINO,2,Will never grant this forfeiture to hold.
The Merchant of Venice,3,3,ANTONIO,1,The duke cannot deny the course of law:
The Merchant of Venice,3,3,ANTONIO,2,For the commodity that strangers have
The Merchant of Venice,3,3,ANTONIO,3,"With us in Venice, if it be denied,"
The Merchant of Venice,3,3,ANTONIO,4,Will much impeach the justice of his state;
The Merchant of Venice,3,3,ANTONIO,5,Since that the trade and profit of the city
The Merchant of Venice,3,3,ANTONIO,6,"Consisteth of all nations. Therefore, go:"
The Merchant of Venice,3,3,ANTONIO,7,"These griefs and losses have so bated me,"
The Merchant of Venice,3,3,ANTONIO,8,That I shall hardly spare a pound of flesh
The Merchant of Venice,3,3,ANTONIO,9,To-morrow to my bloody creditor.
The Merchant of Venice,3,3,ANTONIO,10,"Well, gaoler, on. Pray God, Bassanio come"
The Merchant of Venice,3,3,ANTONIO,11,"To see me pay his debt, and then I care not!"
The Merchant of Venice,3,4,LORENZO,1,"Madam, although I speak it in your presence,"
The Merchant of Venice,3,4,LORENZO,2,You have a noble and a true conceit
The Merchant of Venice,3,4,LORENZO,3,Of godlike amity; which appears most strongly
The Merchant of Venice,3,4,LORENZO,4,In bearing thus the absence of your lord.
The Merchant of Venice,3,4,LORENZO,5,"But if you knew to whom you show this honour,"
The Merchant of Venice,3,4,LORENZO,6,"How true a gentleman you send relief,"
The Merchant of Venice,3,4,LORENZO,7,"How dear a lover of my lord your husband,"
The Merchant of Venice,3,4,LORENZO,8,I know you would be prouder of the work
The Merchant of Venice,3,4,LORENZO,9,Than customary bounty can enforce you.
The Merchant of Venice,3,4,PORTIA,1,"I never did repent for doing good,"
The Merchant of Venice,3,4,PORTIA,2,Nor shall not now: for in companions
The Merchant of Venice,3,4,PORTIA,3,"That do converse and waste the time together,"
The Merchant of Venice,3,4,PORTIA,4,"Whose souls do bear an equal yoke Of love,"
The Merchant of Venice,3,4,PORTIA,5,There must be needs a like proportion
The Merchant of Venice,3,4,PORTIA,6,"Of lineaments, of manners and of spirit;"
The Merchant of Venice,3,4,PORTIA,7,"Which makes me think that this Antonio,"
The Merchant of Venice,3,4,PORTIA,8,"Being the bosom lover of my lord,"
The Merchant of Venice,3,4,PORTIA,9,"Must needs be like my lord. If it be so,"
The Merchant of Venice,3,4,PORTIA,10,How little is the cost I have bestow'd
The Merchant of Venice,3,4,PORTIA,11,In purchasing the semblance of my soul
The Merchant of Venice,3,4,PORTIA,12,From out the state of hellish misery!
The Merchant of Venice,3,4,PORTIA,13,This comes too near the praising of myself;
The Merchant of Venice,3,4,PORTIA,14,Therefore no more of it: hear other things.
The Merchant of Venice,3,4,PORTIA,15,"Lorenzo, I commit into your hands"
The Merchant of Venice,3,4,PORTIA,16,The husbandry and manage of my house
The Merchant of Venice,3,4,PORTIA,17,"Until my lord's return: for mine own part,"
The Merchant of Venice,3,4,PORTIA,18,I have toward heaven breathed a secret vow
The Merchant of Venice,3,4,PORTIA,19,"To live in prayer and contemplation,"
The Merchant of Venice,3,4,PORTIA,20,"Only attended by Nerissa here,"
The Merchant of Venice,3,4,PORTIA,21,Until her husband and my lord's return:
The Merchant of Venice,3,4,PORTIA,22,There is a monastery two miles off;
The Merchant of Venice,3,4,PORTIA,23,And there will we abide. I do desire you
The Merchant of Venice,3,4,PORTIA,24,Not to deny this imposition;
The Merchant of Venice,3,4,PORTIA,25,The which my love and some necessity
The Merchant of Venice,3,4,PORTIA,26,Now lays upon you.
The Merchant of Venice,3,4,LORENZO,1,"Madam, with all my heart;"
The Merchant of Venice,3,4,LORENZO,2,I shall obey you in all fair commands.
The Merchant of Venice,3,4,PORTIA,1,"My people do already know my mind,"
The Merchant of Venice,3,4,PORTIA,2,And will acknowledge you and Jessica
The Merchant of Venice,3,4,PORTIA,3,In place of Lord Bassanio and myself.
The Merchant of Venice,3,4,PORTIA,4,"And so farewell, till we shall meet again."
The Merchant of Venice,3,4,LORENZO,1,Fair thoughts and happy hours attend on you!
The Merchant of Venice,3,4,JESSICA,1,I wish your ladyship all heart's content.
The Merchant of Venice,3,4,PORTIA,1,"I thank you for your wish, and am well pleased"
The Merchant of Venice,3,4,PORTIA,2,To wish it back on you: fare you well Jessica.
The Merchant of Venice,3,4,PORTIA,3,"Now, Balthasar,"
The Merchant of Venice,3,4,PORTIA,4,"As I have ever found thee honest-true,"
The Merchant of Venice,3,4,PORTIA,5,"So let me find thee still. Take this same letter,"
The Merchant of Venice,3,4,PORTIA,6,And use thou all the endeavour of a man
The Merchant of Venice,3,4,PORTIA,7,In speed to Padua: see thou render this
The Merchant of Venice,3,4,PORTIA,8,"Into my cousin's hand, Doctor Bellario;"
The Merchant of Venice,3,4,PORTIA,9,"And, look, what notes and garments he doth give thee,"
The Merchant of Venice,3,4,PORTIA,10,"Bring them, I pray thee, with imagined speed"
The Merchant of Venice,3,4,PORTIA,11,"Unto the tranect, to the common ferry"
The Merchant of Venice,3,4,PORTIA,12,"Which trades to Venice. Waste no time in words,"
The Merchant of Venice,3,4,PORTIA,13,But get thee gone: I shall be there before thee.
The Merchant of Venice,3,4,BALTHASAR,1,"Madam, I go with all convenient speed."
The Merchant of Venice,3,4,PORTIA,1,"Come on, Nerissa; I have work in hand"
The Merchant of Venice,3,4,PORTIA,2,That you yet know not of: we'll see our husbands
The Merchant of Venice,3,4,PORTIA,3,Before they think of us.
The Merchant of Venice,3,4,NERISSA,1,Shall they see us?
The Merchant of Venice,3,4,PORTIA,1,"They shall, Nerissa; but in such a habit,"
The Merchant of Venice,3,4,PORTIA,2,That they shall think we are accomplished
The Merchant of Venice,3,4,PORTIA,3,"With that we lack. I'll hold thee any wager,"
The Merchant of Venice,3,4,PORTIA,4,"When we are both accoutred like young men,"
The Merchant of Venice,3,4,PORTIA,5,"I'll prove the prettier fellow of the two,"
The Merchant of Venice,3,4,PORTIA,6,"And wear my dagger with the braver grace,"
The Merchant of Venice,3,4,PORTIA,7,And speak between the change of man and boy
The Merchant of Venice,3,4,PORTIA,8,"With a reed voice, and turn two mincing steps"
The Merchant of Venice,3,4,PORTIA,9,"Into a manly stride, and speak of frays"
The Merchant of Venice,3,4,PORTIA,10,"Like a fine bragging youth, and tell quaint lies,"
The Merchant of Venice,3,4,PORTIA,11,"How honourable ladies sought my love,"
The Merchant of Venice,3,4,PORTIA,12,"Which I denying, they fell sick and died;"
The Merchant of Venice,3,4,PORTIA,13,"I could not do withal; then I'll repent,"
The Merchant of Venice,3,4,PORTIA,14,"And wish for all that, that I had not killed them;"
The Merchant of Venice,3,4,PORTIA,15,"And twenty of these puny lies I'll tell,"
The Merchant of Venice,3,4,PORTIA,16,That men shall swear I have discontinued school
The Merchant of Venice,3,4,PORTIA,17,Above a twelvemonth. I have within my mind
The Merchant of Venice,3,4,PORTIA,18,"A thousand raw tricks of these bragging Jacks,"
The Merchant of Venice,3,4,PORTIA,19,Which I will practise.
The Merchant of Venice,3,4,NERISSA,1,"Why, shall we turn to men?"
The Merchant of Venice,3,4,PORTIA,1,"Fie, what a question's that,"
The Merchant of Venice,3,4,PORTIA,2,If thou wert near a lewd interpreter!
The Merchant of Venice,3,4,PORTIA,3,"But come, I'll tell thee all my whole device"
The Merchant of Venice,3,4,PORTIA,4,"When I am in my coach, which stays for us"
The Merchant of Venice,3,4,PORTIA,5,"At the park gate; and therefore haste away,"
The Merchant of Venice,3,4,PORTIA,6,For we must measure twenty miles to-day.
The Merchant of Venice,3,5,LAUNCELOT,1,"Yes, truly; for, look you, the sins of the father"
The Merchant of Venice,3,5,LAUNCELOT,2,"are to be laid upon the children: therefore, I"
The Merchant of Venice,3,5,LAUNCELOT,3,"promise ye, I fear you. I was always plain with"
The Merchant of Venice,3,5,LAUNCELOT,4,"you, and so now I speak my agitation of the matter:"
The Merchant of Venice,3,5,LAUNCELOT,5,"therefore be of good cheer, for truly I think you"
The Merchant of Venice,3,5,LAUNCELOT,6,are damned. There is but one hope in it that can do
The Merchant of Venice,3,5,LAUNCELOT,7,you any good; and that is but a kind of bastard
The Merchant of Venice,3,5,LAUNCELOT,8,hope neither.
The Merchant of Venice,3,5,JESSICA,1,"And what hope is that, I pray thee?"
The Merchant of Venice,3,5,LAUNCELOT,1,"Marry, you may partly hope that your father got you"
The Merchant of Venice,3,5,LAUNCELOT,2,"not, that you are not the Jew's daughter."
The Merchant of Venice,3,5,JESSICA,1,"That were a kind of bastard hope, indeed: so the"
The Merchant of Venice,3,5,JESSICA,2,sins of my mother should be visited upon me.
The Merchant of Venice,3,5,LAUNCELOT,1,Truly then I fear you are damned both by father and
The Merchant of Venice,3,5,LAUNCELOT,2,"mother: thus when I shun Scylla, your father, I"
The Merchant of Venice,3,5,LAUNCELOT,3,"fall into Charybdis, your mother: well, you are"
The Merchant of Venice,3,5,LAUNCELOT,4,gone both ways.
The Merchant of Venice,3,5,JESSICA,1,I shall be saved by my husband; he hath made me a
The Merchant of Venice,3,5,JESSICA,2,Christian.
The Merchant of Venice,3,5,LAUNCELOT,1,"Truly, the more to blame he: we were Christians"
The Merchant of Venice,3,5,LAUNCELOT,2,"enow before; e'en as many as could well live, one by"
The Merchant of Venice,3,5,LAUNCELOT,3,another. This making Christians will raise the
The Merchant of Venice,3,5,LAUNCELOT,4,"price of hogs: if we grow all to be pork-eaters, we"
The Merchant of Venice,3,5,LAUNCELOT,5,shall not shortly have a rasher on the coals for money.
The Merchant of Venice,3,5,JESSICA,1,"I'll tell my husband, Launcelot, what you say: here he comes."
The Merchant of Venice,3,5,LORENZO,1,"I shall grow jealous of you shortly, Launcelot, if"
The Merchant of Venice,3,5,LORENZO,2,you thus get my wife into corners.
The Merchant of Venice,3,5,JESSICA,1,"Nay, you need not fear us, Lorenzo: Launcelot and I"
The Merchant of Venice,3,5,JESSICA,2,"are out. He tells me flatly, there is no mercy for"
The Merchant of Venice,3,5,JESSICA,3,"me in heaven, because I am a Jew's daughter: and he"
The Merchant of Venice,3,5,JESSICA,4,"says, you are no good member of the commonwealth,"
The Merchant of Venice,3,5,JESSICA,5,"for in converting Jews to Christians, you raise the"
The Merchant of Venice,3,5,JESSICA,6,price of pork.
The Merchant of Venice,3,5,LORENZO,1,I shall answer that better to the commonwealth than
The Merchant of Venice,3,5,LORENZO,2,you can the getting up of the negro's belly: the
The Merchant of Venice,3,5,LORENZO,3,"Moor is with child by you, Launcelot."
The Merchant of Venice,3,5,LAUNCELOT,1,It is much that the Moor should be more than reason:
The Merchant of Venice,3,5,LAUNCELOT,2,"but if she be less than an honest woman, she is"
The Merchant of Venice,3,5,LAUNCELOT,3,indeed more than I took her for.
The Merchant of Venice,3,5,LORENZO,1,How every fool can play upon the word! I think the
The Merchant of Venice,3,5,LORENZO,2,"best grace of wit will shortly turn into silence,"
The Merchant of Venice,3,5,LORENZO,3,and discourse grow commendable in none only but
The Merchant of Venice,3,5,LORENZO,4,"parrots. Go in, sirrah; bid them prepare for dinner."
The Merchant of Venice,3,5,LAUNCELOT,1,"That is done, sir; they have all stomachs."
The Merchant of Venice,3,5,LORENZO,1,"Goodly Lord, what a wit-snapper are you! then bid"
The Merchant of Venice,3,5,LORENZO,2,them prepare dinner.
The Merchant of Venice,3,5,LAUNCELOT,1,"That is done too, sir; only 'cover' is the word."
The Merchant of Venice,3,5,LORENZO,1,"Will you cover then, sir?"
The Merchant of Venice,3,5,LAUNCELOT,1,"Not so, sir, neither; I know my duty."
The Merchant of Venice,3,5,LORENZO,1,Yet more quarrelling with occasion! Wilt thou show
The Merchant of Venice,3,5,LORENZO,2,the whole wealth of thy wit in an instant? I pray
The Merchant of Venice,3,5,LORENZO,3,"tree, understand a plain man in his plain meaning:"
The Merchant of Venice,3,5,LORENZO,4,"go to thy fellows; bid them cover the table, serve"
The Merchant of Venice,3,5,LORENZO,5,"in the meat, and we will come in to dinner."
The Merchant of Venice,3,5,LAUNCELOT,1,"For the table, sir, it shall be served in; for the"
The Merchant of Venice,3,5,LAUNCELOT,2,"meat, sir, it shall be covered; for your coming in"
The Merchant of Venice,3,5,LAUNCELOT,3,"to dinner, sir, why, let it be as humours and"
The Merchant of Venice,3,5,LAUNCELOT,4,conceits shall govern.
The Merchant of Venice,3,5,LORENZO,1,"O dear discretion, how his words are suited!"
The Merchant of Venice,3,5,LORENZO,2,The fool hath planted in his memory
The Merchant of Venice,3,5,LORENZO,3,An army of good words; and I do know
The Merchant of Venice,3,5,LORENZO,4,"A many fools, that stand in better place,"
The Merchant of Venice,3,5,LORENZO,5,"Garnish'd like him, that for a tricksy word"
The Merchant of Venice,3,5,LORENZO,6,"Defy the matter. How cheerest thou, Jessica?"
The Merchant of Venice,3,5,LORENZO,7,"And now, good sweet, say thy opinion,"
The Merchant of Venice,3,5,LORENZO,8,How dost thou like the Lord Bassanio's wife?
The Merchant of Venice,3,5,JESSICA,1,Past all expressing. It is very meet
The Merchant of Venice,3,5,JESSICA,2,The Lord Bassanio live an upright life;
The Merchant of Venice,3,5,JESSICA,3,"For, having such a blessing in his lady,"
The Merchant of Venice,3,5,JESSICA,4,He finds the joys of heaven here on earth;
The Merchant of Venice,3,5,JESSICA,5,"And if on earth he do not mean it, then"
The Merchant of Venice,3,5,JESSICA,6,In reason he should never come to heaven
The Merchant of Venice,3,5,JESSICA,7,"Why, if two gods should play some heavenly match"
The Merchant of Venice,3,5,JESSICA,8,"And on the wager lay two earthly women,"
The Merchant of Venice,3,5,JESSICA,9,"And Portia one, there must be something else"
The Merchant of Venice,3,5,JESSICA,10,"Pawn'd with the other, for the poor rude world"
The Merchant of Venice,3,5,JESSICA,11,Hath not her fellow.
The Merchant of Venice,3,5,LORENZO,1,Even such a husband
The Merchant of Venice,3,5,LORENZO,2,Hast thou of me as she is for a wife.
The Merchant of Venice,3,5,JESSICA,1,"Nay, but ask my opinion too of that."
The Merchant of Venice,3,5,LORENZO,1,"I will anon: first, let us go to dinner."
The Merchant of Venice,3,5,JESSICA,1,"Nay, let me praise you while I have a stomach."
The Merchant of Venice,3,5,LORENZO,1,"No, pray thee, let it serve for table-talk;"
The Merchant of Venice,3,5,LORENZO,2,"' Then, howso'er thou speak'st, 'mong other things"
The Merchant of Venice,3,5,LORENZO,3,I shall digest it.
The Merchant of Venice,3,5,JESSICA,1,"Well, I'll set you forth."
The Merchant of Venice,4,1,DUKE,1,"What, is Antonio here?"
The Merchant of Venice,4,1,ANTONIO,1,"Ready, so please your grace."
The Merchant of Venice,4,1,DUKE,1,I am sorry for thee: thou art come to answer
The Merchant of Venice,4,1,DUKE,2,"A stony adversary, an inhuman wretch"
The Merchant of Venice,4,1,DUKE,3,"uncapable of pity, void and empty"
The Merchant of Venice,4,1,DUKE,4,From any dram of mercy.
The Merchant of Venice,4,1,ANTONIO,1,I have heard
The Merchant of Venice,4,1,ANTONIO,2,Your grace hath ta'en great pains to qualify
The Merchant of Venice,4,1,ANTONIO,3,His rigorous course; but since he stands obdurate
The Merchant of Venice,4,1,ANTONIO,4,And that no lawful means can carry me
The Merchant of Venice,4,1,ANTONIO,5,"Out of his envy's reach, I do oppose"
The Merchant of Venice,4,1,ANTONIO,6,"My patience to his fury, and am arm'd"
The Merchant of Venice,4,1,ANTONIO,7,"To suffer, with a quietness of spirit,"
The Merchant of Venice,4,1,ANTONIO,8,The very tyranny and rage of his.
The Merchant of Venice,4,1,DUKE,1,"Go one, and call the Jew into the court."
The Merchant of Venice,4,1,SALERIO,1,"He is ready at the door: he comes, my lord."
The Merchant of Venice,4,1,DUKE,1,"Make room, and let him stand before our face."
The Merchant of Venice,4,1,DUKE,2,"Shylock, the world thinks, and I think so too,"
The Merchant of Venice,4,1,DUKE,3,That thou but lead'st this fashion of thy malice
The Merchant of Venice,4,1,DUKE,4,To the last hour of act; and then 'tis thought
The Merchant of Venice,4,1,DUKE,5,Thou'lt show thy mercy and remorse more strange
The Merchant of Venice,4,1,DUKE,6,Than is thy strange apparent cruelty;
The Merchant of Venice,4,1,DUKE,7,"And where thou now exact'st the penalty,"
The Merchant of Venice,4,1,DUKE,8,"Which is a pound of this poor merchant's flesh,"
The Merchant of Venice,4,1,DUKE,9,"Thou wilt not only loose the forfeiture,"
The Merchant of Venice,4,1,DUKE,10,"But, touch'd with human gentleness and love,"
The Merchant of Venice,4,1,DUKE,11,Forgive a moiety of the principal;
The Merchant of Venice,4,1,DUKE,12,"Glancing an eye of pity on his losses,"
The Merchant of Venice,4,1,DUKE,13,"That have of late so huddled on his back,"
The Merchant of Venice,4,1,DUKE,14,Enow to press a royal merchant down
The Merchant of Venice,4,1,DUKE,15,And pluck commiseration of his state
The Merchant of Venice,4,1,DUKE,16,"From brassy bosoms and rough hearts of flint,"
The Merchant of Venice,4,1,DUKE,17,"From stubborn Turks and Tartars, never train'd"
The Merchant of Venice,4,1,DUKE,18,To offices of tender courtesy.
The Merchant of Venice,4,1,DUKE,19,"We all expect a gentle answer, Jew."
The Merchant of Venice,4,1,SHYLOCK,1,I have possess'd your grace of what I purpose;
The Merchant of Venice,4,1,SHYLOCK,2,And by our holy Sabbath have I sworn
The Merchant of Venice,4,1,SHYLOCK,3,To have the due and forfeit of my bond:
The Merchant of Venice,4,1,SHYLOCK,4,"If you deny it, let the danger light"
The Merchant of Venice,4,1,SHYLOCK,5,Upon your charter and your city's freedom.
The Merchant of Venice,4,1,SHYLOCK,6,"You'll ask me, why I rather choose to have"
The Merchant of Venice,4,1,SHYLOCK,7,A weight of carrion flesh than to receive
The Merchant of Venice,4,1,SHYLOCK,8,Three thousand ducats: I'll not answer that:
The Merchant of Venice,4,1,SHYLOCK,9,"But, say, it is my humour: is it answer'd?"
The Merchant of Venice,4,1,SHYLOCK,10,What if my house be troubled with a rat
The Merchant of Venice,4,1,SHYLOCK,11,And I be pleased to give ten thousand ducats
The Merchant of Venice,4,1,SHYLOCK,12,"To have it baned? What, are you answer'd yet?"
The Merchant of Venice,4,1,SHYLOCK,13,Some men there are love not a gaping pig;
The Merchant of Venice,4,1,SHYLOCK,14,"Some, that are mad if they behold a cat;"
The Merchant of Venice,4,1,SHYLOCK,15,"And others, when the bagpipe sings i' the nose,"
The Merchant of Venice,4,1,SHYLOCK,16,"Cannot contain their urine: for affection,"
The Merchant of Venice,4,1,SHYLOCK,17,"Mistress of passion, sways it to the mood"
The Merchant of Venice,4,1,SHYLOCK,18,"Of what it likes or loathes. Now, for your answer:"
The Merchant of Venice,4,1,SHYLOCK,19,"As there is no firm reason to be render'd,"
The Merchant of Venice,4,1,SHYLOCK,20,Why he cannot abide a gaping pig;
The Merchant of Venice,4,1,SHYLOCK,21,"Why he, a harmless necessary cat;"
The Merchant of Venice,4,1,SHYLOCK,22,"Why he, a woollen bagpipe; but of force"
The Merchant of Venice,4,1,SHYLOCK,23,Must yield to such inevitable shame
The Merchant of Venice,4,1,SHYLOCK,24,"As to offend, himself being offended;"
The Merchant of Venice,4,1,SHYLOCK,25,"So can I give no reason, nor I will not,"
The Merchant of Venice,4,1,SHYLOCK,26,More than a lodged hate and a certain loathing
The Merchant of Venice,4,1,SHYLOCK,27,"I bear Antonio, that I follow thus"
The Merchant of Venice,4,1,SHYLOCK,28,A losing suit against him. Are you answer'd?
The Merchant of Venice,4,1,BASSANIO,1,"This is no answer, thou unfeeling man,"
The Merchant of Venice,4,1,BASSANIO,2,To excuse the current of thy cruelty.
The Merchant of Venice,4,1,SHYLOCK,1,I am not bound to please thee with my answers.
The Merchant of Venice,4,1,BASSANIO,1,Do all men kill the things they do not love?
The Merchant of Venice,4,1,SHYLOCK,1,Hates any man the thing he would not kill?
The Merchant of Venice,4,1,BASSANIO,1,Every offence is not a hate at first.
The Merchant of Venice,4,1,SHYLOCK,1,"What, wouldst thou have a serpent sting thee twice?"
The Merchant of Venice,4,1,ANTONIO,1,"I pray you, think you question with the Jew:"
The Merchant of Venice,4,1,ANTONIO,2,You may as well go stand upon the beach
The Merchant of Venice,4,1,ANTONIO,3,And bid the main flood bate his usual height;
The Merchant of Venice,4,1,ANTONIO,4,You may as well use question with the wolf
The Merchant of Venice,4,1,ANTONIO,5,Why he hath made the ewe bleat for the lamb;
The Merchant of Venice,4,1,ANTONIO,6,You may as well forbid the mountain pines
The Merchant of Venice,4,1,ANTONIO,7,"To wag their high tops and to make no noise,"
The Merchant of Venice,4,1,ANTONIO,8,When they are fretten with the gusts of heaven;
The Merchant of Venice,4,1,ANTONIO,9,"You may as well do anything most hard,"
The Merchant of Venice,4,1,ANTONIO,10,As seek to soften that--than which what's harder?--
The Merchant of Venice,4,1,ANTONIO,11,"His Jewish heart: therefore, I do beseech you,"
The Merchant of Venice,4,1,ANTONIO,12,"Make no more offers, use no farther means,"
The Merchant of Venice,4,1,ANTONIO,13,But with all brief and plain conveniency
The Merchant of Venice,4,1,ANTONIO,14,Let me have judgment and the Jew his will.
The Merchant of Venice,4,1,BASSANIO,1,For thy three thousand ducats here is six.
The Merchant of Venice,4,1,SHYLOCK,1,"What judgment shall I dread, doing"
The Merchant of Venice,4,1,SHYLOCK,2,"Were in six parts and every part a ducat,"
The Merchant of Venice,4,1,SHYLOCK,3,I would not draw them; I would have my bond.
The Merchant of Venice,4,1,DUKE,1,"How shalt thou hope for mercy, rendering none?"
The Merchant of Venice,4,1,SHYLOCK,1,"What judgment shall I dread, doing no wrong?"
The Merchant of Venice,4,1,SHYLOCK,2,"You have among you many a purchased slave,"
The Merchant of Venice,4,1,SHYLOCK,3,"Which, like your asses and your dogs and mules,"
The Merchant of Venice,4,1,SHYLOCK,4,"You use in abject and in slavish parts,"
The Merchant of Venice,4,1,SHYLOCK,5,"Because you bought them: shall I say to you,"
The Merchant of Venice,4,1,SHYLOCK,6,"Let them be free, marry them to your heirs?"
The Merchant of Venice,4,1,SHYLOCK,7,Why sweat they under burthens? let their beds
The Merchant of Venice,4,1,SHYLOCK,8,Be made as soft as yours and let their palates
The Merchant of Venice,4,1,SHYLOCK,9,Be season'd with such viands? You will answer
The Merchant of Venice,4,1,SHYLOCK,10,'The slaves are ours:' so do I answer you:
The Merchant of Venice,4,1,SHYLOCK,11,"The pound of flesh, which I demand of him,"
The Merchant of Venice,4,1,SHYLOCK,12,Is dearly bought; 'tis mine and I will have it.
The Merchant of Venice,4,1,SHYLOCK,13,"If you deny me, fie upon your law!"
The Merchant of Venice,4,1,SHYLOCK,14,There is no force in the decrees of Venice.
The Merchant of Venice,4,1,SHYLOCK,15,I stand for judgment: answer; shall I have it?
The Merchant of Venice,4,1,DUKE,1,"Upon my power I may dismiss this court,"
The Merchant of Venice,4,1,DUKE,2,"Unless Bellario, a learned doctor,"
The Merchant of Venice,4,1,DUKE,3,"Whom I have sent for to determine this,"
The Merchant of Venice,4,1,DUKE,4,Come here to-day.
The Merchant of Venice,4,1,SALERIO,1,"My lord, here stays without"
The Merchant of Venice,4,1,SALERIO,2,"A messenger with letters from the doctor,"
The Merchant of Venice,4,1,SALERIO,3,New come from Padua.
The Merchant of Venice,4,1,DUKE,1,Bring us the letter; call the messenger.
The Merchant of Venice,4,1,BASSANIO,1,"Good cheer, Antonio! What, man, courage yet!"
The Merchant of Venice,4,1,BASSANIO,2,"The Jew shall have my flesh, blood, bones and all,"
The Merchant of Venice,4,1,BASSANIO,3,Ere thou shalt lose for me one drop of blood.
The Merchant of Venice,4,1,ANTONIO,1,"I am a tainted wether of the flock,"
The Merchant of Venice,4,1,ANTONIO,2,Meetest for death: the weakest kind of fruit
The Merchant of Venice,4,1,ANTONIO,3,Drops earliest to the ground; and so let me
The Merchant of Venice,4,1,ANTONIO,4,"You cannot better be employ'd, Bassanio,"
The Merchant of Venice,4,1,ANTONIO,5,Than to live still and write mine epitaph.
The Merchant of Venice,4,1,DUKE,1,"Came you from Padua, from Bellario?"
The Merchant of Venice,4,1,NERISSA,1,"From both, my lord. Bellario greets your grace."
The Merchant of Venice,4,1,BASSANIO,1,Why dost thou whet thy knife so earnestly?
The Merchant of Venice,4,1,SHYLOCK,1,To cut the forfeiture from that bankrupt there.
The Merchant of Venice,4,1,GRATIANO,1,"Not on thy sole, but on thy soul, harsh Jew,"
The Merchant of Venice,4,1,GRATIANO,2,"Thou makest thy knife keen; but no metal can,"
The Merchant of Venice,4,1,GRATIANO,3,"No, not the hangman's axe, bear half the keenness"
The Merchant of Venice,4,1,GRATIANO,4,Of thy sharp envy. Can no prayers pierce thee?
The Merchant of Venice,4,1,SHYLOCK,1,"No, none that thou hast wit enough to make."
The Merchant of Venice,4,1,GRATIANO,1,"O, be thou damn'd, inexecrable dog!"
The Merchant of Venice,4,1,GRATIANO,2,And for thy life let justice be accused.
The Merchant of Venice,4,1,GRATIANO,3,Thou almost makest me waver in my faith
The Merchant of Venice,4,1,GRATIANO,4,"To hold opinion with Pythagoras,"
The Merchant of Venice,4,1,GRATIANO,5,That souls of animals infuse themselves
The Merchant of Venice,4,1,GRATIANO,6,Into the trunks of men: thy currish spirit
The Merchant of Venice,4,1,GRATIANO,7,"Govern'd a wolf, who, hang'd for human slaughter,"
The Merchant of Venice,4,1,GRATIANO,8,"Even from the gallows did his fell soul fleet,"
The Merchant of Venice,4,1,GRATIANO,9,"And, whilst thou lay'st in thy unhallow'd dam,"
The Merchant of Venice,4,1,GRATIANO,10,Infused itself in thee; for thy desires
The Merchant of Venice,4,1,GRATIANO,11,"Are wolvish, bloody, starved and ravenous."
The Merchant of Venice,4,1,SHYLOCK,1,"Till thou canst rail the seal from off my bond,"
The Merchant of Venice,4,1,SHYLOCK,2,Thou but offend'st thy lungs to speak so loud:
The Merchant of Venice,4,1,SHYLOCK,3,"Repair thy wit, good youth, or it will fall"
The Merchant of Venice,4,1,SHYLOCK,4,To cureless ruin. I stand here for law.
The Merchant of Venice,4,1,DUKE,1,This letter from Bellario doth commend
The Merchant of Venice,4,1,DUKE,2,A young and learned doctor to our court.
The Merchant of Venice,4,1,DUKE,3,Where is he?
The Merchant of Venice,4,1,NERISSA,1,"He attendeth here hard by,"
The Merchant of Venice,4,1,NERISSA,2,"To know your answer, whether you'll admit him."
The Merchant of Venice,4,1,DUKE,1,With all my heart. Some three or four of you
The Merchant of Venice,4,1,DUKE,2,Go give him courteous conduct to this place.
The Merchant of Venice,4,1,DUKE,3,Meantime the court shall hear Bellario's letter.
The Merchant of Venice,4,1,CLERK,1,Your grace shall understand that at the receipt of
The Merchant of Venice,4,1,CLERK,2,your letter I am very sick: but in the instant that
The Merchant of Venice,4,1,CLERK,3,"your messenger came, in loving visitation was with"
The Merchant of Venice,4,1,CLERK,4,me a young doctor of Rome; his name is Balthasar. I
The Merchant of Venice,4,1,CLERK,5,acquainted him with the cause in controversy between
The Merchant of Venice,4,1,CLERK,6,the Jew and Antonio the merchant: we turned o'er
The Merchant of Venice,4,1,CLERK,7,many books together: he is furnished with my
The Merchant of Venice,4,1,CLERK,8,"opinion; which, bettered with his own learning, the"
The Merchant of Venice,4,1,CLERK,9,"greatness whereof I cannot enough commend, comes"
The Merchant of Venice,4,1,CLERK,10,"with him, at my importunity, to fill up your grace's"
The Merchant of Venice,4,1,CLERK,11,"request in my stead. I beseech you, let his lack of"
The Merchant of Venice,4,1,CLERK,12,years be no impediment to let him lack a reverend
The Merchant of Venice,4,1,CLERK,13,estimation; for I never knew so young a body with so
The Merchant of Venice,4,1,CLERK,14,old a head. I leave him to your gracious
The Merchant of Venice,4,1,CLERK,15,"acceptance, whose trial shall better publish his"
The Merchant of Venice,4,1,CLERK,16,commendation.
The Merchant of Venice,4,1,DUKE,1,"You hear the learn'd Bellario, what he writes:"
The Merchant of Venice,4,1,DUKE,2,"And here, I take it, is the doctor come."
The Merchant of Venice,4,1,DUKE,3,Give me your hand. Come you from old Bellario?
The Merchant of Venice,4,1,PORTIA,1,"I did, my lord."
The Merchant of Venice,4,1,DUKE,1,You are welcome: take your place.
The Merchant of Venice,4,1,DUKE,2,Are you acquainted with the difference
The Merchant of Venice,4,1,DUKE,3,That holds this present question in the court?
The Merchant of Venice,4,1,PORTIA,1,I am informed thoroughly of the cause.
The Merchant of Venice,4,1,PORTIA,2,"Which is the merchant here, and which the Jew?"
The Merchant of Venice,4,1,DUKE,1,"Antonio and old Shylock, both stand forth."
The Merchant of Venice,4,1,PORTIA,1,Is your name Shylock?
The Merchant of Venice,4,1,SHYLOCK,1,Shylock is my name.
The Merchant of Venice,4,1,PORTIA,1,Of a strange nature is the suit you follow;
The Merchant of Venice,4,1,PORTIA,2,Yet in such rule that the Venetian law
The Merchant of Venice,4,1,PORTIA,3,Cannot impugn you as you do proceed.
The Merchant of Venice,4,1,PORTIA,4,"You stand within his danger, do you not?"
The Merchant of Venice,4,1,ANTONIO,1,"Ay, so he says."
The Merchant of Venice,4,1,PORTIA,1,Do you confess the bond?
The Merchant of Venice,4,1,ANTONIO,1,I do.
The Merchant of Venice,4,1,PORTIA,1,Then must the Jew be merciful.
The Merchant of Venice,4,1,SHYLOCK,1,On what compulsion must I? tell me that.
The Merchant of Venice,4,1,PORTIA,1,"The quality of mercy is not strain'd,"
The Merchant of Venice,4,1,PORTIA,2,It droppeth as the gentle rain from heaven
The Merchant of Venice,4,1,PORTIA,3,Upon the place beneath: it is twice blest;
The Merchant of Venice,4,1,PORTIA,4,It blesseth him that gives and him that takes:
The Merchant of Venice,4,1,PORTIA,5,'Tis mightiest in the mightiest: it becomes
The Merchant of Venice,4,1,PORTIA,6,The throned monarch better than his crown;
The Merchant of Venice,4,1,PORTIA,7,"His sceptre shows the force of temporal power,"
The Merchant of Venice,4,1,PORTIA,8,"The attribute to awe and majesty,"
The Merchant of Venice,4,1,PORTIA,9,Wherein doth sit the dread and fear of kings;
The Merchant of Venice,4,1,PORTIA,10,But mercy is above this sceptred sway;
The Merchant of Venice,4,1,PORTIA,11,"It is enthroned in the hearts of kings,"
The Merchant of Venice,4,1,PORTIA,12,It is an attribute to God himself;
The Merchant of Venice,4,1,PORTIA,13,And earthly power doth then show likest God's
The Merchant of Venice,4,1,PORTIA,14,"When mercy seasons justice. Therefore, Jew,"
The Merchant of Venice,4,1,PORTIA,15,"Though justice be thy plea, consider this,"
The Merchant of Venice,4,1,PORTIA,16,"That, in the course of justice, none of us"
The Merchant of Venice,4,1,PORTIA,17,Should see salvation: we do pray for mercy;
The Merchant of Venice,4,1,PORTIA,18,And that same prayer doth teach us all to render
The Merchant of Venice,4,1,PORTIA,19,The deeds of mercy. I have spoke thus much
The Merchant of Venice,4,1,PORTIA,20,To mitigate the justice of thy plea;
The Merchant of Venice,4,1,PORTIA,21,"Which if thou follow, this strict court of Venice"
The Merchant of Venice,4,1,PORTIA,22,Must needs give sentence 'gainst the merchant there.
The Merchant of Venice,4,1,SHYLOCK,1,"My deeds upon my head! I crave the law,"
The Merchant of Venice,4,1,SHYLOCK,2,The penalty and forfeit of my bond.
The Merchant of Venice,4,1,PORTIA,1,Is he not able to discharge the money?
The Merchant of Venice,4,1,BASSANIO,1,"Yes, here I tender it for him in the court;"
The Merchant of Venice,4,1,BASSANIO,2,"Yea, twice the sum: if that will not suffice,"
The Merchant of Venice,4,1,BASSANIO,3,"I will be bound to pay it ten times o'er,"
The Merchant of Venice,4,1,BASSANIO,4,"On forfeit of my hands, my head, my heart:"
The Merchant of Venice,4,1,BASSANIO,5,"If this will not suffice, it must appear"
The Merchant of Venice,4,1,BASSANIO,6,"That malice bears down truth. And I beseech you,"
The Merchant of Venice,4,1,BASSANIO,7,Wrest once the law to your authority:
The Merchant of Venice,4,1,BASSANIO,8,"To do a great right, do a little wrong,"
The Merchant of Venice,4,1,BASSANIO,9,And curb this cruel devil of his will.
The Merchant of Venice,4,1,PORTIA,1,It must not be; there is no power in Venice
The Merchant of Venice,4,1,PORTIA,2,Can alter a decree established:
The Merchant of Venice,4,1,PORTIA,3,"'Twill be recorded for a precedent,"
The Merchant of Venice,4,1,PORTIA,4,And many an error by the same example
The Merchant of Venice,4,1,PORTIA,5,Will rush into the state: it cannot be.
The Merchant of Venice,4,1,SHYLOCK,1,"A Daniel come to judgment! yea, a Daniel!"
The Merchant of Venice,4,1,SHYLOCK,2,"O wise young judge, how I do honour thee!"
The Merchant of Venice,4,1,PORTIA,1,"I pray you, let me look upon the bond."
The Merchant of Venice,4,1,SHYLOCK,1,"Here 'tis, most reverend doctor, here it is."
The Merchant of Venice,4,1,PORTIA,1,"Shylock, there's thrice thy money offer'd thee."
The Merchant of Venice,4,1,SHYLOCK,1,"An oath, an oath, I have an oath in heaven:"
The Merchant of Venice,4,1,SHYLOCK,2,Shall I lay perjury upon my soul?
The Merchant of Venice,4,1,SHYLOCK,3,"No, not for Venice."
The Merchant of Venice,4,1,PORTIA,1,"Why, this bond is forfeit;"
The Merchant of Venice,4,1,PORTIA,2,And lawfully by this the Jew may claim
The Merchant of Venice,4,1,PORTIA,3,"A pound of flesh, to be by him cut off"
The Merchant of Venice,4,1,PORTIA,4,Nearest the merchant's heart. Be merciful:
The Merchant of Venice,4,1,PORTIA,5,Take thrice thy money; bid me tear the bond.
The Merchant of Venice,4,1,SHYLOCK,1,When it is paid according to the tenor.
The Merchant of Venice,4,1,SHYLOCK,2,It doth appear you are a worthy judge;
The Merchant of Venice,4,1,SHYLOCK,3,"You know the law, your exposition"
The Merchant of Venice,4,1,SHYLOCK,4,"Hath been most sound: I charge you by the law,"
The Merchant of Venice,4,1,SHYLOCK,5,"Whereof you are a well-deserving pillar,"
The Merchant of Venice,4,1,SHYLOCK,6,Proceed to judgment: by my soul I swear
The Merchant of Venice,4,1,SHYLOCK,7,There is no power in the tongue of man
The Merchant of Venice,4,1,SHYLOCK,8,To alter me: I stay here on my bond.
The Merchant of Venice,4,1,ANTONIO,1,Most heartily I do beseech the court
The Merchant of Venice,4,1,ANTONIO,2,To give the judgment.
The Merchant of Venice,4,1,PORTIA,1,"Why then, thus it is:"
The Merchant of Venice,4,1,PORTIA,2,You must prepare your bosom for his knife.
The Merchant of Venice,4,1,SHYLOCK,1,O noble judge! O excellent young man!
The Merchant of Venice,4,1,PORTIA,1,For the intent and purpose of the law
The Merchant of Venice,4,1,PORTIA,2,"Hath full relation to the penalty,"
The Merchant of Venice,4,1,PORTIA,3,Which here appeareth due upon the bond.
The Merchant of Venice,4,1,SHYLOCK,1,'Tis very true: O wise and upright judge!
The Merchant of Venice,4,1,SHYLOCK,2,How much more elder art thou than thy looks!
The Merchant of Venice,4,1,PORTIA,1,Therefore lay bare your bosom.
The Merchant of Venice,4,1,SHYLOCK,1,"Ay, his breast:"
The Merchant of Venice,4,1,SHYLOCK,2,"So says the bond: doth it not, noble judge?"
The Merchant of Venice,4,1,SHYLOCK,3,'Nearest his heart:' those are the very words.
The Merchant of Venice,4,1,PORTIA,1,It is so. Are there balance here to weigh
The Merchant of Venice,4,1,PORTIA,2,The flesh?
The Merchant of Venice,4,1,SHYLOCK,1,I have them ready.
The Merchant of Venice,4,1,PORTIA,1,"Have by some surgeon, Shylock, on your charge,"
The Merchant of Venice,4,1,PORTIA,2,"To stop his wounds, lest he do bleed to death."
The Merchant of Venice,4,1,SHYLOCK,1,Is it so nominated in the bond?
The Merchant of Venice,4,1,PORTIA,1,It is not so express'd: but what of that?
The Merchant of Venice,4,1,PORTIA,2,'Twere good you do so much for charity.
The Merchant of Venice,4,1,SHYLOCK,1,I cannot find it; 'tis not in the bond.
The Merchant of Venice,4,1,PORTIA,1,"You, merchant, have you any thing to say?"
The Merchant of Venice,4,1,ANTONIO,1,But little: I am arm'd and well prepared.
The Merchant of Venice,4,1,ANTONIO,2,"Give me your hand, Bassanio: fare you well!"
The Merchant of Venice,4,1,ANTONIO,3,Grieve not that I am fallen to this for you;
The Merchant of Venice,4,1,ANTONIO,4,For herein Fortune shows herself more kind
The Merchant of Venice,4,1,ANTONIO,5,Than is her custom: it is still her use
The Merchant of Venice,4,1,ANTONIO,6,"To let the wretched man outlive his wealth,"
The Merchant of Venice,4,1,ANTONIO,7,To view with hollow eye and wrinkled brow
The Merchant of Venice,4,1,ANTONIO,8,An age of poverty; from which lingering penance
The Merchant of Venice,4,1,ANTONIO,9,Of such misery doth she cut me off.
The Merchant of Venice,4,1,ANTONIO,10,Commend me to your honourable wife:
The Merchant of Venice,4,1,ANTONIO,11,Tell her the process of Antonio's end;
The Merchant of Venice,4,1,ANTONIO,12,"Say how I loved you, speak me fair in death;"
The Merchant of Venice,4,1,ANTONIO,13,"And, when the tale is told, bid her be judge"
The Merchant of Venice,4,1,ANTONIO,14,Whether Bassanio had not once a love.
The Merchant of Venice,4,1,ANTONIO,15,"Repent but you that you shall lose your friend,"
The Merchant of Venice,4,1,ANTONIO,16,And he repents not that he pays your debt;
The Merchant of Venice,4,1,ANTONIO,17,"For if the Jew do cut but deep enough,"
The Merchant of Venice,4,1,ANTONIO,18,I'll pay it presently with all my heart.
The Merchant of Venice,4,1,BASSANIO,1,"Antonio, I am married to a wife"
The Merchant of Venice,4,1,BASSANIO,2,Which is as dear to me as life itself;
The Merchant of Venice,4,1,BASSANIO,3,"But life itself, my wife, and all the world,"
The Merchant of Venice,4,1,BASSANIO,4,Are not with me esteem'd above thy life:
The Merchant of Venice,4,1,BASSANIO,5,"I would lose all, ay, sacrifice them all"
The Merchant of Venice,4,1,BASSANIO,6,"Here to this devil, to deliver you."
The Merchant of Venice,4,1,PORTIA,1,"Your wife would give you little thanks for that,"
The Merchant of Venice,4,1,PORTIA,2,"If she were by, to hear you make the offer."
The Merchant of Venice,4,1,GRATIANO,1,"I have a wife, whom, I protest, I love:"
The Merchant of Venice,4,1,GRATIANO,2,"I would she were in heaven, so she could"
The Merchant of Venice,4,1,GRATIANO,3,Entreat some power to change this currish Jew.
The Merchant of Venice,4,1,NERISSA,1,'Tis well you offer it behind her back;
The Merchant of Venice,4,1,NERISSA,2,The wish would make else an unquiet house.
The Merchant of Venice,4,1,SHYLOCK,1,These be the Christian husbands. I have a daughter;
The Merchant of Venice,4,1,SHYLOCK,2,Would any of the stock of Barrabas
The Merchant of Venice,4,1,SHYLOCK,3,Had been her husband rather than a Christian!
The Merchant of Venice,4,1,SHYLOCK,4,"We trifle time: I pray thee, pursue sentence."
The Merchant of Venice,4,1,PORTIA,1,A pound of that same merchant's flesh is thine:
The Merchant of Venice,4,1,PORTIA,2,"The court awards it, and the law doth give it."
The Merchant of Venice,4,1,SHYLOCK,1,Most rightful judge!
The Merchant of Venice,4,1,PORTIA,1,And you must cut this flesh from off his breast:
The Merchant of Venice,4,1,PORTIA,2,"The law allows it, and the court awards it."
The Merchant of Venice,4,1,SHYLOCK,1,"Most learned judge! A sentence! Come, prepare!"
The Merchant of Venice,4,1,PORTIA,1,Tarry a little; there is something else.
The Merchant of Venice,4,1,PORTIA,2,This bond doth give thee here no jot of blood;
The Merchant of Venice,4,1,PORTIA,3,The words expressly are 'a pound of flesh:'
The Merchant of Venice,4,1,PORTIA,4,"Take then thy bond, take thou thy pound of flesh;"
The Merchant of Venice,4,1,PORTIA,5,"But, in the cutting it, if thou dost shed"
The Merchant of Venice,4,1,PORTIA,6,"One drop of Christian blood, thy lands and goods"
The Merchant of Venice,4,1,PORTIA,7,"Are, by the laws of Venice, confiscate"
The Merchant of Venice,4,1,PORTIA,8,Unto the state of Venice.
The Merchant of Venice,4,1,GRATIANO,1,"O upright judge! Mark, Jew: O learned judge!"
The Merchant of Venice,4,1,SHYLOCK,1,Is that the law?
The Merchant of Venice,4,1,PORTIA,1,Thyself shalt see the act:
The Merchant of Venice,4,1,PORTIA,2,"For, as thou urgest justice, be assured"
The Merchant of Venice,4,1,PORTIA,3,"Thou shalt have justice, more than thou desirest."
The Merchant of Venice,4,1,GRATIANO,1,"O learned judge! Mark, Jew: a learned judge!"
The Merchant of Venice,4,1,SHYLOCK,1,"I take this offer, then; pay the bond thrice"
The Merchant of Venice,4,1,SHYLOCK,2,And let the Christian go.
The Merchant of Venice,4,1,BASSANIO,1,Here is the money.
The Merchant of Venice,4,1,PORTIA,1,Soft!
The Merchant of Venice,4,1,PORTIA,2,The Jew shall have all justice; soft! no haste:
The Merchant of Venice,4,1,PORTIA,3,He shall have nothing but the penalty.
The Merchant of Venice,4,1,GRATIANO,1,"O Jew! an upright judge, a learned judge!"
The Merchant of Venice,4,1,PORTIA,1,Therefore prepare thee to cut off the flesh.
The Merchant of Venice,4,1,PORTIA,2,"Shed thou no blood, nor cut thou less nor more"
The Merchant of Venice,4,1,PORTIA,3,But just a pound of flesh: if thou cut'st more
The Merchant of Venice,4,1,PORTIA,4,"Or less than a just pound, be it but so much"
The Merchant of Venice,4,1,PORTIA,5,"As makes it light or heavy in the substance,"
The Merchant of Venice,4,1,PORTIA,6,Or the division of the twentieth part
The Merchant of Venice,4,1,PORTIA,7,"Of one poor scruple, nay, if the scale do turn"
The Merchant of Venice,4,1,PORTIA,8,"But in the estimation of a hair,"
The Merchant of Venice,4,1,PORTIA,9,Thou diest and all thy goods are confiscate.
The Merchant of Venice,4,1,GRATIANO,1,"A second Daniel, a Daniel, Jew!"
The Merchant of Venice,4,1,GRATIANO,2,"Now, infidel, I have you on the hip."
The Merchant of Venice,4,1,PORTIA,1,Why doth the Jew pause? take thy forfeiture.
The Merchant of Venice,4,1,SHYLOCK,1,"Give me my principal, and let me go."
The Merchant of Venice,4,1,BASSANIO,1,I have it ready for thee; here it is.
The Merchant of Venice,4,1,PORTIA,1,He hath refused it in the open court:
The Merchant of Venice,4,1,PORTIA,2,He shall have merely justice and his bond.
The Merchant of Venice,4,1,GRATIANO,1,"A Daniel, still say I, a second Daniel!"
The Merchant of Venice,4,1,GRATIANO,2,"I thank thee, Jew, for teaching me that word."
The Merchant of Venice,4,1,SHYLOCK,1,Shall I not have barely my principal?
The Merchant of Venice,4,1,PORTIA,1,"Thou shalt have nothing but the forfeiture,"
The Merchant of Venice,4,1,PORTIA,2,"To be so taken at thy peril, Jew."
The Merchant of Venice,4,1,SHYLOCK,1,"Why, then the devil give him good of it!"
The Merchant of Venice,4,1,SHYLOCK,2,I'll stay no longer question.
The Merchant of Venice,4,1,PORTIA,1,"Tarry, Jew:"
The Merchant of Venice,4,1,PORTIA,2,The law hath yet another hold on you.
The Merchant of Venice,4,1,PORTIA,3,"It is enacted in the laws of Venice,"
The Merchant of Venice,4,1,PORTIA,4,If it be proved against an alien
The Merchant of Venice,4,1,PORTIA,5,That by direct or indirect attempts
The Merchant of Venice,4,1,PORTIA,6,"He seek the life of any citizen,"
The Merchant of Venice,4,1,PORTIA,7,The party 'gainst the which he doth contrive
The Merchant of Venice,4,1,PORTIA,8,Shall seize one half his goods; the other half
The Merchant of Venice,4,1,PORTIA,9,Comes to the privy coffer of the state;
The Merchant of Venice,4,1,PORTIA,10,And the offender's life lies in the mercy
The Merchant of Venice,4,1,PORTIA,11,"Of the duke only, 'gainst all other voice."
The Merchant of Venice,4,1,PORTIA,12,"In which predicament, I say, thou stand'st;"
The Merchant of Venice,4,1,PORTIA,13,"For it appears, by manifest proceeding,"
The Merchant of Venice,4,1,PORTIA,14,That indirectly and directly too
The Merchant of Venice,4,1,PORTIA,15,Thou hast contrived against the very life
The Merchant of Venice,4,1,PORTIA,16,Of the defendant; and thou hast incurr'd
The Merchant of Venice,4,1,PORTIA,17,The danger formerly by me rehearsed.
The Merchant of Venice,4,1,PORTIA,18,Down therefore and beg mercy of the duke.
The Merchant of Venice,4,1,GRATIANO,1,Beg that thou mayst have leave to hang thyself:
The Merchant of Venice,4,1,GRATIANO,2,"And yet, thy wealth being forfeit to the state,"
The Merchant of Venice,4,1,GRATIANO,3,Thou hast not left the value of a cord;
The Merchant of Venice,4,1,GRATIANO,4,Therefore thou must be hang'd at the state's charge.
The Merchant of Venice,4,1,DUKE,1,"That thou shalt see the difference of our spirits,"
The Merchant of Venice,4,1,DUKE,2,I pardon thee thy life before thou ask it:
The Merchant of Venice,4,1,DUKE,3,"For half thy wealth, it is Antonio's;"
The Merchant of Venice,4,1,DUKE,4,"The other half comes to the general state,"
The Merchant of Venice,4,1,DUKE,5,Which humbleness may drive unto a fine.
The Merchant of Venice,4,1,PORTIA,1,"Ay, for the state, not for Antonio."
The Merchant of Venice,4,1,SHYLOCK,1,"Nay, take my life and all; pardon not that:"
The Merchant of Venice,4,1,SHYLOCK,2,You take my house when you do take the prop
The Merchant of Venice,4,1,SHYLOCK,3,That doth sustain my house; you take my life
The Merchant of Venice,4,1,SHYLOCK,4,When you do take the means whereby I live.
The Merchant of Venice,4,1,PORTIA,1,"What mercy can you render him, Antonio?"
The Merchant of Venice,4,1,GRATIANO,1,"A halter gratis; nothing else, for God's sake."
The Merchant of Venice,4,1,ANTONIO,1,So please my lord the duke and all the court
The Merchant of Venice,4,1,ANTONIO,2,"To quit the fine for one half of his goods,"
The Merchant of Venice,4,1,ANTONIO,3,I am content; so he will let me have
The Merchant of Venice,4,1,ANTONIO,4,"The other half in use, to render it,"
The Merchant of Venice,4,1,ANTONIO,5,"Upon his death, unto the gentleman"
The Merchant of Venice,4,1,ANTONIO,6,That lately stole his daughter:
The Merchant of Venice,4,1,ANTONIO,7,"Two things provided more, that, for this favour,"
The Merchant of Venice,4,1,ANTONIO,8,He presently become a Christian;
The Merchant of Venice,4,1,ANTONIO,9,"The other, that he do record a gift,"
The Merchant of Venice,4,1,ANTONIO,10,"Here in the court, of all he dies possess'd,"
The Merchant of Venice,4,1,ANTONIO,11,Unto his son Lorenzo and his daughter.
The Merchant of Venice,4,1,DUKE,1,"He shall do this, or else I do recant"
The Merchant of Venice,4,1,DUKE,2,The pardon that I late pronounced here.
The Merchant of Venice,4,1,PORTIA,1,"Art thou contented, Jew? what dost thou say?"
The Merchant of Venice,4,1,SHYLOCK,1,I am content.
The Merchant of Venice,4,1,PORTIA,1,"Clerk, draw a deed of gift."
The Merchant of Venice,4,1,SHYLOCK,1,"I pray you, give me leave to go from hence;"
The Merchant of Venice,4,1,SHYLOCK,2,"I am not well: send the deed after me,"
The Merchant of Venice,4,1,SHYLOCK,3,And I will sign it.
The Merchant of Venice,4,1,DUKE,1,"Get thee gone, but do it."
The Merchant of Venice,4,1,GRATIANO,1,In christening shalt thou have two god-fathers:
The Merchant of Venice,4,1,GRATIANO,2,"Had I been judge, thou shouldst have had ten more,"
The Merchant of Venice,4,1,GRATIANO,3,"To bring thee to the gallows, not the font."
The Merchant of Venice,4,1,DUKE,1,"Sir, I entreat you home with me to dinner."
The Merchant of Venice,4,1,PORTIA,1,I humbly do desire your grace of pardon:
The Merchant of Venice,4,1,PORTIA,2,"I must away this night toward Padua,"
The Merchant of Venice,4,1,PORTIA,3,And it is meet I presently set forth.
The Merchant of Venice,4,1,DUKE,1,I am sorry that your leisure serves you not.
The Merchant of Venice,4,1,DUKE,2,"Antonio, gratify this gentleman,"
The Merchant of Venice,4,1,DUKE,3,"For, in my mind, you are much bound to him."
The Merchant of Venice,4,1,BASSANIO,1,"Most worthy gentleman, I and my friend"
The Merchant of Venice,4,1,BASSANIO,2,Have by your wisdom been this day acquitted
The Merchant of Venice,4,1,BASSANIO,3,"Of grievous penalties; in lieu whereof,"
The Merchant of Venice,4,1,BASSANIO,4,"Three thousand ducats, due unto the Jew,"
The Merchant of Venice,4,1,BASSANIO,5,We freely cope your courteous pains withal.
The Merchant of Venice,4,1,ANTONIO,1,"And stand indebted, over and above,"
The Merchant of Venice,4,1,ANTONIO,2,In love and service to you evermore.
The Merchant of Venice,4,1,PORTIA,1,He is well paid that is well satisfied;
The Merchant of Venice,4,1,PORTIA,2,"And I, delivering you, am satisfied"
The Merchant of Venice,4,1,PORTIA,3,And therein do account myself well paid:
The Merchant of Venice,4,1,PORTIA,4,My mind was never yet more mercenary.
The Merchant of Venice,4,1,PORTIA,5,"I pray you, know me when we meet again:"
The Merchant of Venice,4,1,PORTIA,6,"I wish you well, and so I take my leave."
The Merchant of Venice,4,1,BASSANIO,1,"Dear sir, of force I must attempt you further:"
The Merchant of Venice,4,1,BASSANIO,2,"Take some remembrance of us, as a tribute,"
The Merchant of Venice,4,1,BASSANIO,3,"Not as a fee: grant me two things, I pray you,"
The Merchant of Venice,4,1,BASSANIO,4,"Not to deny me, and to pardon me."
The Merchant of Venice,4,1,PORTIA,1,"You press me far, and therefore I will yield."
The Merchant of Venice,4,1,PORTIA,2,"Give me your gloves, I'll wear them for your sake;"
The Merchant of Venice,4,1,PORTIA,3,"And, for your love, I'll take this ring from you:"
The Merchant of Venice,4,1,PORTIA,4,Do not draw back your hand; I'll take no more;
The Merchant of Venice,4,1,PORTIA,5,And you in love shall not deny me this.
The Merchant of Venice,4,1,BASSANIO,1,"This ring, good sir, alas, it is a trifle!"
The Merchant of Venice,4,1,BASSANIO,2,I will not shame myself to give you this.
The Merchant of Venice,4,1,PORTIA,1,I will have nothing else but only this;
The Merchant of Venice,4,1,PORTIA,2,And now methinks I have a mind to it.
The Merchant of Venice,4,1,BASSANIO,1,There's more depends on this than on the value.
The Merchant of Venice,4,1,BASSANIO,2,"The dearest ring in Venice will I give you,"
The Merchant of Venice,4,1,BASSANIO,3,And find it out by proclamation:
The Merchant of Venice,4,1,BASSANIO,4,"Only for this, I pray you, pardon me."
The Merchant of Venice,4,1,PORTIA,1,"I see, sir, you are liberal in offers"
The Merchant of Venice,4,1,PORTIA,2,You taught me first to beg; and now methinks
The Merchant of Venice,4,1,PORTIA,3,You teach me how a beggar should be answer'd.
The Merchant of Venice,4,1,BASSANIO,1,"Good sir, this ring was given me by my wife;"
The Merchant of Venice,4,1,BASSANIO,2,"And when she put it on, she made me vow"
The Merchant of Venice,4,1,BASSANIO,3,That I should neither sell nor give nor lose it.
The Merchant of Venice,4,1,PORTIA,1,That 'scuse serves many men to save their gifts.
The Merchant of Venice,4,1,PORTIA,2,"An if your wife be not a mad-woman,"
The Merchant of Venice,4,1,PORTIA,3,"And know how well I have deserved the ring,"
The Merchant of Venice,4,1,PORTIA,4,"She would not hold out enemy for ever,"
The Merchant of Venice,4,1,PORTIA,5,"For giving it to me. Well, peace be with you!"
The Merchant of Venice,4,1,ANTONIO,1,"My Lord Bassanio, let him have the ring:"
The Merchant of Venice,4,1,ANTONIO,2,Let his deservings and my love withal
The Merchant of Venice,4,1,ANTONIO,3,Be valued against your wife's commandment.
The Merchant of Venice,4,1,BASSANIO,1,"Go, Gratiano, run and overtake him;"
The Merchant of Venice,4,1,BASSANIO,2,"Give him the ring, and bring him, if thou canst,"
The Merchant of Venice,4,1,BASSANIO,3,Unto Antonio's house: away! make haste.
The Merchant of Venice,4,1,BASSANIO,4,"Come, you and I will thither presently;"
The Merchant of Venice,4,1,BASSANIO,5,And in the morning early will we both
The Merchant of Venice,4,1,BASSANIO,6,"Fly toward Belmont: come, Antonio."
The Merchant of Venice,4,2,PORTIA,1,"Inquire the Jew's house out, give him this deed"
The Merchant of Venice,4,2,PORTIA,2,And let him sign it: we'll away to-night
The Merchant of Venice,4,2,PORTIA,3,And be a day before our husbands home:
The Merchant of Venice,4,2,PORTIA,4,This deed will be well welcome to Lorenzo.
The Merchant of Venice,4,2,GRATIANO,1,"Fair sir, you are well o'erta'en"
The Merchant of Venice,4,2,GRATIANO,2,My Lord Bassanio upon more advice
The Merchant of Venice,4,2,GRATIANO,3,"Hath sent you here this ring, and doth entreat"
The Merchant of Venice,4,2,GRATIANO,4,Your company at dinner.
The Merchant of Venice,4,2,PORTIA,1,That cannot be:
The Merchant of Venice,4,2,PORTIA,2,His ring I do accept most thankfully:
The Merchant of Venice,4,2,PORTIA,3,"And so, I pray you, tell him: furthermore,"
The Merchant of Venice,4,2,PORTIA,4,"I pray you, show my youth old Shylock's house."
The Merchant of Venice,4,2,GRATIANO,1,That will I do.
The Merchant of Venice,4,2,NERISSA,1,"Sir, I would speak with you."
The Merchant of Venice,4,2,NERISSA,2,"I'll see if I can get my husband's ring,"
The Merchant of Venice,4,2,NERISSA,3,Which I did make him swear to keep for ever.
The Merchant of Venice,4,2,PORTIA,1,We shall have old swearing
The Merchant of Venice,4,2,PORTIA,2,That they did give the rings away to men;
The Merchant of Venice,4,2,PORTIA,3,"But we'll outface them, and outswear them too."
The Merchant of Venice,4,2,PORTIA,4,Away! make haste: thou knowist where I will tarry.
The Merchant of Venice,4,2,NERISSA,1,"Come, good sir, will you show me to this house?"
The Merchant of Venice,5,1,LORENZO,1,"The moon shines bright: in such a night as this,"
The Merchant of Venice,5,1,LORENZO,2,When the sweet wind did gently kiss the trees
The Merchant of Venice,5,1,LORENZO,3,"And they did make no noise, in such a night"
The Merchant of Venice,5,1,LORENZO,4,Troilus methinks mounted the Troyan walls
The Merchant of Venice,5,1,LORENZO,5,"And sigh'd his soul toward the Grecian tents,"
The Merchant of Venice,5,1,LORENZO,6,Where Cressid lay that night.
The Merchant of Venice,5,1,JESSICA,1,In such a night
The Merchant of Venice,5,1,JESSICA,2,Did Thisbe fearfully o'ertrip the dew
The Merchant of Venice,5,1,JESSICA,3,And saw the lion's shadow ere himself
The Merchant of Venice,5,1,JESSICA,4,And ran dismay'd away.
The Merchant of Venice,5,1,LORENZO,1,In such a night
The Merchant of Venice,5,1,LORENZO,2,Stood Dido with a willow in her hand
The Merchant of Venice,5,1,LORENZO,3,Upon the wild sea banks and waft her love
The Merchant of Venice,5,1,LORENZO,4,To come again to Carthage.
The Merchant of Venice,5,1,JESSICA,1,In such a night
The Merchant of Venice,5,1,JESSICA,2,Medea gather'd the enchanted herbs
The Merchant of Venice,5,1,JESSICA,3,That did renew old AEson.
The Merchant of Venice,5,1,LORENZO,1,In such a night
The Merchant of Venice,5,1,LORENZO,2,Did Jessica steal from the wealthy Jew
The Merchant of Venice,5,1,LORENZO,3,And with an unthrift love did run from Venice
The Merchant of Venice,5,1,LORENZO,4,As far as Belmont.
The Merchant of Venice,5,1,JESSICA,1,In such a night
The Merchant of Venice,5,1,JESSICA,2,"Did young Lorenzo swear he loved her well,"
The Merchant of Venice,5,1,JESSICA,3,Stealing her soul with many vows of faith
The Merchant of Venice,5,1,JESSICA,4,And ne'er a true one.
The Merchant of Venice,5,1,LORENZO,1,In such a night
The Merchant of Venice,5,1,LORENZO,2,"Did pretty Jessica, like a little shrew,"
The Merchant of Venice,5,1,LORENZO,3,"Slander her love, and he forgave it her."
The Merchant of Venice,5,1,JESSICA,1,"I would out-night you, did no body come;"
The Merchant of Venice,5,1,JESSICA,2,"But, hark, I hear the footing of a man."
The Merchant of Venice,5,1,LORENZO,1,Who comes so fast in silence of the night?
The Merchant of Venice,5,1,STEPHANO,1,A friend.
The Merchant of Venice,5,1,LORENZO,1,"A friend! what friend? your name, I pray you, friend?"
The Merchant of Venice,5,1,STEPHANO,1,Stephano is my name; and I bring word
The Merchant of Venice,5,1,STEPHANO,2,My mistress will before the break of day
The Merchant of Venice,5,1,STEPHANO,3,Be here at Belmont; she doth stray about
The Merchant of Venice,5,1,STEPHANO,4,"By holy crosses, where she kneels and prays"
The Merchant of Venice,5,1,STEPHANO,5,For happy wedlock hours.
The Merchant of Venice,5,1,LORENZO,1,Who comes with her?
The Merchant of Venice,5,1,STEPHANO,1,None but a holy hermit and her maid.
The Merchant of Venice,5,1,STEPHANO,2,"I pray you, is my master yet return'd?"
The Merchant of Venice,5,1,LORENZO,1,"He is not, nor we have not heard from him."
The Merchant of Venice,5,1,LORENZO,2,"But go we in, I pray thee, Jessica,"
The Merchant of Venice,5,1,LORENZO,3,And ceremoniously let us prepare
The Merchant of Venice,5,1,LORENZO,4,Some welcome for the mistress of the house.
The Merchant of Venice,5,1,LAUNCELOT,1,"Sola, sola! wo ha, ho! sola, sola!"
The Merchant of Venice,5,1,LORENZO,1,Who calls?
The Merchant of Venice,5,1,LAUNCELOT,1,Sola! did you see Master Lorenzo?
The Merchant of Venice,5,1,LAUNCELOT,2,"Master Lorenzo, sola, sola!"
The Merchant of Venice,5,1,LORENZO,1,"Leave hollaing, man: here."
The Merchant of Venice,5,1,LAUNCELOT,1,Sola! where? where?
The Merchant of Venice,5,1,LORENZO,1,Here.
The Merchant of Venice,5,1,LAUNCELOT,1,"Tell him there's a post come from my master, with"
The Merchant of Venice,5,1,LAUNCELOT,2,his horn full of good news: my master will be here
The Merchant of Venice,5,1,LAUNCELOT,3,ere morning.
The Merchant of Venice,5,1,LORENZO,1,"Sweet soul, let's in, and there expect their coming."
The Merchant of Venice,5,1,LORENZO,2,And yet no matter: why should we go in?
The Merchant of Venice,5,1,LORENZO,3,"My friend Stephano, signify, I pray you,"
The Merchant of Venice,5,1,LORENZO,4,"Within the house, your mistress is at hand;"
The Merchant of Venice,5,1,LORENZO,5,And bring your music forth into the air.
The Merchant of Venice,5,1,LORENZO,6,How sweet the moonlight sleeps upon this bank!
The Merchant of Venice,5,1,LORENZO,7,Here will we sit and let the sounds of music
The Merchant of Venice,5,1,LORENZO,8,Creep in our ears: soft stillness and the night
The Merchant of Venice,5,1,LORENZO,9,Become the touches of sweet harmony.
The Merchant of Venice,5,1,LORENZO,10,"Sit, Jessica. Look how the floor of heaven"
The Merchant of Venice,5,1,LORENZO,11,Is thick inlaid with patines of bright gold:
The Merchant of Venice,5,1,LORENZO,12,There's not the smallest orb which thou behold'st
The Merchant of Venice,5,1,LORENZO,13,"But in his motion like an angel sings,"
The Merchant of Venice,5,1,LORENZO,14,Still quiring to the young-eyed cherubins;
The Merchant of Venice,5,1,LORENZO,15,Such harmony is in immortal souls;
The Merchant of Venice,5,1,LORENZO,16,But whilst this muddy vesture of decay
The Merchant of Venice,5,1,LORENZO,17,"Doth grossly close it in, we cannot hear it."
The Merchant of Venice,5,1,LORENZO,18,"Come, ho! and wake Diana with a hymn!"
The Merchant of Venice,5,1,LORENZO,19,"With sweetest touches pierce your mistress' ear,"
The Merchant of Venice,5,1,LORENZO,20,And draw her home with music.
The Merchant of Venice,5,1,JESSICA,1,I am never merry when I hear sweet music.
The Merchant of Venice,5,1,LORENZO,1,"The reason is, your spirits are attentive:"
The Merchant of Venice,5,1,LORENZO,2,"For do but note a wild and wanton herd,"
The Merchant of Venice,5,1,LORENZO,3,"Or race of youthful and unhandled colts,"
The Merchant of Venice,5,1,LORENZO,4,"Fetching mad bounds, bellowing and neighing loud,"
The Merchant of Venice,5,1,LORENZO,5,Which is the hot condition of their blood;
The Merchant of Venice,5,1,LORENZO,6,"If they but hear perchance a trumpet sound,"
The Merchant of Venice,5,1,LORENZO,7,"Or any air of music touch their ears,"
The Merchant of Venice,5,1,LORENZO,8,"You shall perceive them make a mutual stand,"
The Merchant of Venice,5,1,LORENZO,9,Their savage eyes turn'd to a modest gaze
The Merchant of Venice,5,1,LORENZO,10,By the sweet power of music: therefore the poet
The Merchant of Venice,5,1,LORENZO,11,"Did feign that Orpheus drew trees, stones and floods;"
The Merchant of Venice,5,1,LORENZO,12,"Since nought so stockish, hard and full of rage,"
The Merchant of Venice,5,1,LORENZO,13,But music for the time doth change his nature.
The Merchant of Venice,5,1,LORENZO,14,"The man that hath no music in himself,"
The Merchant of Venice,5,1,LORENZO,15,"Nor is not moved with concord of sweet sounds,"
The Merchant of Venice,5,1,LORENZO,16,"Is fit for treasons, stratagems and spoils;"
The Merchant of Venice,5,1,LORENZO,17,The motions of his spirit are dull as night
The Merchant of Venice,5,1,LORENZO,18,And his affections dark as Erebus:
The Merchant of Venice,5,1,LORENZO,19,Let no such man be trusted. Mark the music.
The Merchant of Venice,5,1,PORTIA,1,That light we see is burning in my hall.
The Merchant of Venice,5,1,PORTIA,2,How far that little candle throws his beams!
The Merchant of Venice,5,1,PORTIA,3,So shines a good deed in a naughty world.
The Merchant of Venice,5,1,NERISSA,1,"When the moon shone, we did not see the candle."
The Merchant of Venice,5,1,PORTIA,1,So doth the greater glory dim the less:
The Merchant of Venice,5,1,PORTIA,2,A substitute shines brightly as a king
The Merchant of Venice,5,1,PORTIA,3,"Unto the king be by, and then his state"
The Merchant of Venice,5,1,PORTIA,4,"Empties itself, as doth an inland brook"
The Merchant of Venice,5,1,PORTIA,5,Into the main of waters. Music! hark!
The Merchant of Venice,5,1,NERISSA,1,"It is your music, madam, of the house."
The Merchant of Venice,5,1,PORTIA,1,"Nothing is good, I see, without respect:"
The Merchant of Venice,5,1,PORTIA,2,Methinks it sounds much sweeter than by day.
The Merchant of Venice,5,1,NERISSA,1,"Silence bestows that virtue on it, madam."
The Merchant of Venice,5,1,PORTIA,1,"The crow doth sing as sweetly as the lark,"
The Merchant of Venice,5,1,PORTIA,2,"When neither is attended, and I think"
The Merchant of Venice,5,1,PORTIA,3,"The nightingale, if she should sing by day,"
The Merchant of Venice,5,1,PORTIA,4,"When every goose is cackling, would be thought"
The Merchant of Venice,5,1,PORTIA,5,No better a musician than the wren.
The Merchant of Venice,5,1,PORTIA,6,How many things by season season'd are
The Merchant of Venice,5,1,PORTIA,7,To their right praise and true perfection!
The Merchant of Venice,5,1,PORTIA,8,"Peace, ho! the moon sleeps with Endymion"
The Merchant of Venice,5,1,PORTIA,9,And would not be awaked.
The Merchant of Venice,5,1,LORENZO,1,"That is the voice,"
The Merchant of Venice,5,1,LORENZO,2,"Or I am much deceived, of Portia."
The Merchant of Venice,5,1,PORTIA,1,"He knows me as the blind man knows the cuckoo,"
The Merchant of Venice,5,1,PORTIA,2,By the bad voice.
The Merchant of Venice,5,1,LORENZO,1,"Dear lady, welcome home."
The Merchant of Venice,5,1,PORTIA,1,"We have been praying for our husbands' healths,"
The Merchant of Venice,5,1,PORTIA,2,"Which speed, we hope, the better for our words."
The Merchant of Venice,5,1,PORTIA,3,Are they return'd?
The Merchant of Venice,5,1,LORENZO,1,"Madam, they are not yet;"
The Merchant of Venice,5,1,LORENZO,2,"But there is come a messenger before,"
The Merchant of Venice,5,1,LORENZO,3,To signify their coming.
The Merchant of Venice,5,1,PORTIA,1,"Go in, Nerissa;"
The Merchant of Venice,5,1,PORTIA,2,Give order to my servants that they take
The Merchant of Venice,5,1,PORTIA,3,No note at all of our being absent hence;
The Merchant of Venice,5,1,PORTIA,4,"Nor you, Lorenzo; Jessica, nor you."
The Merchant of Venice,5,1,LORENZO,1,Your husband is at hand; I hear his trumpet:
The Merchant of Venice,5,1,LORENZO,2,"We are no tell-tales, madam; fear you not."
The Merchant of Venice,5,1,PORTIA,1,This night methinks is but the daylight sick;
The Merchant of Venice,5,1,PORTIA,2,"It looks a little paler: 'tis a day,"
The Merchant of Venice,5,1,PORTIA,3,Such as the day is when the sun is hid.
The Merchant of Venice,5,1,BASSANIO,1,"We should hold day with the Antipodes,"
The Merchant of Venice,5,1,BASSANIO,2,If you would walk in absence of the sun.
The Merchant of Venice,5,1,PORTIA,1,"Let me give light, but let me not be light;"
The Merchant of Venice,5,1,PORTIA,2,"For a light wife doth make a heavy husband,"
The Merchant of Venice,5,1,PORTIA,3,And never be Bassanio so for me:
The Merchant of Venice,5,1,PORTIA,4,"But God sort all! You are welcome home, my lord."
The Merchant of Venice,5,1,BASSANIO,1,"I thank you, madam. Give welcome to my friend."
The Merchant of Venice,5,1,BASSANIO,2,"This is the man, this is Antonio,"
The Merchant of Venice,5,1,BASSANIO,3,To whom I am so infinitely bound.
The Merchant of Venice,5,1,PORTIA,1,You should in all sense be much bound to him.
The Merchant of Venice,5,1,PORTIA,2,"For, as I hear, he was much bound for you."
The Merchant of Venice,5,1,ANTONIO,1,No more than I am well acquitted of.
The Merchant of Venice,5,1,PORTIA,1,"Sir, you are very welcome to our house:"
The Merchant of Venice,5,1,PORTIA,2,"It must appear in other ways than words,"
The Merchant of Venice,5,1,PORTIA,3,Therefore I scant this breathing courtesy.
The Merchant of Venice,5,1,GRATIANO,1,"In faith, I gave it to the judge's clerk:"
The Merchant of Venice,5,1,GRATIANO,2,"Would he were gelt that had it, for my part,"
The Merchant of Venice,5,1,GRATIANO,3,"Since you do take it, love, so much at heart."
The Merchant of Venice,5,1,PORTIA,1,"A quarrel, ho, already! what's the matter?"
The Merchant of Venice,5,1,GRATIANO,1,"About a hoop of gold, a paltry ring"
The Merchant of Venice,5,1,GRATIANO,2,"That she did give me, whose posy was"
The Merchant of Venice,5,1,GRATIANO,3,For all the world like cutler's poetry
The Merchant of Venice,5,1,GRATIANO,4,"Upon a knife, 'Love me, and leave me not.'"
The Merchant of Venice,5,1,NERISSA,1,What talk you of the posy or the value?
The Merchant of Venice,5,1,NERISSA,2,"You swore to me, when I did give it you,"
The Merchant of Venice,5,1,NERISSA,3,That you would wear it till your hour of death
The Merchant of Venice,5,1,NERISSA,4,And that it should lie with you in your grave:
The Merchant of Venice,5,1,NERISSA,5,"Though not for me, yet for your vehement oaths,"
The Merchant of Venice,5,1,NERISSA,6,You should have been respective and have kept it.
The Merchant of Venice,5,1,NERISSA,7,"Gave it a judge's clerk! no, God's my judge,"
The Merchant of Venice,5,1,NERISSA,8,The clerk will ne'er wear hair on's face that had it.
The Merchant of Venice,5,1,GRATIANO,1,"He will, an if he live to be a man."
The Merchant of Venice,5,1,NERISSA,1,"Ay, if a woman live to be a man."
The Merchant of Venice,5,1,GRATIANO,1,"Now, by this hand, I gave it to a youth,"
The Merchant of Venice,5,1,GRATIANO,2,"A kind of boy, a little scrubbed boy,"
The Merchant of Venice,5,1,GRATIANO,3,"No higher than thyself; the judge's clerk,"
The Merchant of Venice,5,1,GRATIANO,4,"A prating boy, that begg'd it as a fee:"
The Merchant of Venice,5,1,GRATIANO,5,I could not for my heart deny it him.
The Merchant of Venice,5,1,PORTIA,1,"You were to blame, I must be plain with you,"
The Merchant of Venice,5,1,PORTIA,2,To part so slightly with your wife's first gift:
The Merchant of Venice,5,1,PORTIA,3,A thing stuck on with oaths upon your finger
The Merchant of Venice,5,1,PORTIA,4,And so riveted with faith unto your flesh.
The Merchant of Venice,5,1,PORTIA,5,I gave my love a ring and made him swear
The Merchant of Venice,5,1,PORTIA,6,Never to part with it; and here he stands;
The Merchant of Venice,5,1,PORTIA,7,I dare be sworn for him he would not leave it
The Merchant of Venice,5,1,PORTIA,8,"Nor pluck it from his finger, for the wealth"
The Merchant of Venice,5,1,PORTIA,9,"That the world masters. Now, in faith, Gratiano,"
The Merchant of Venice,5,1,PORTIA,10,You give your wife too unkind a cause of grief:
The Merchant of Venice,5,1,PORTIA,11,"An 'twere to me, I should be mad at it."
The Merchant of Venice,5,1,BASSANIO,1,And swear I lost the ring defending it.
The Merchant of Venice,5,1,GRATIANO,1,My Lord Bassanio gave his ring away
The Merchant of Venice,5,1,GRATIANO,2,Unto the judge that begg'd it and indeed
The Merchant of Venice,5,1,GRATIANO,3,"Deserved it too; and then the boy, his clerk,"
The Merchant of Venice,5,1,GRATIANO,4,"That took some pains in writing, he begg'd mine;"
The Merchant of Venice,5,1,GRATIANO,5,And neither man nor master would take aught
The Merchant of Venice,5,1,GRATIANO,6,But the two rings.
The Merchant of Venice,5,1,PORTIA,1,What ring gave you my lord?
The Merchant of Venice,5,1,PORTIA,2,"Not that, I hope, which you received of me."
The Merchant of Venice,5,1,BASSANIO,1,"If I could add a lie unto a fault,"
The Merchant of Venice,5,1,BASSANIO,2,I would deny it; but you see my finger
The Merchant of Venice,5,1,BASSANIO,3,Hath not the ring upon it; it is gone.
The Merchant of Venice,5,1,PORTIA,1,Even so void is your false heart of truth.
The Merchant of Venice,5,1,PORTIA,2,"By heaven, I will ne'er come in your bed"
The Merchant of Venice,5,1,PORTIA,3,Until I see the ring.
The Merchant of Venice,5,1,NERISSA,1,Nor I in yours
The Merchant of Venice,5,1,NERISSA,2,Till I again see mine.
The Merchant of Venice,5,1,BASSANIO,1,"Sweet Portia,"
The Merchant of Venice,5,1,BASSANIO,2,"If you did know to whom I gave the ring,"
The Merchant of Venice,5,1,BASSANIO,3,If you did know for whom I gave the ring
The Merchant of Venice,5,1,BASSANIO,4,And would conceive for what I gave the ring
The Merchant of Venice,5,1,BASSANIO,5,"And how unwillingly I left the ring,"
The Merchant of Venice,5,1,BASSANIO,6,"When nought would be accepted but the ring,"
The Merchant of Venice,5,1,BASSANIO,7,You would abate the strength of your displeasure.
The Merchant of Venice,5,1,PORTIA,1,"If you had known the virtue of the ring,"
The Merchant of Venice,5,1,PORTIA,2,"Or half her worthiness that gave the ring,"
The Merchant of Venice,5,1,PORTIA,3,"Or your own honour to contain the ring,"
The Merchant of Venice,5,1,PORTIA,4,You would not then have parted with the ring.
The Merchant of Venice,5,1,PORTIA,5,"What man is there so much unreasonable,"
The Merchant of Venice,5,1,PORTIA,6,If you had pleased to have defended it
The Merchant of Venice,5,1,PORTIA,7,"With any terms of zeal, wanted the modesty"
The Merchant of Venice,5,1,PORTIA,8,To urge the thing held as a ceremony?
The Merchant of Venice,5,1,PORTIA,9,Nerissa teaches me what to believe:
The Merchant of Venice,5,1,PORTIA,10,I'll die for't but some woman had the ring.
The Merchant of Venice,5,1,BASSANIO,1,"No, by my honour, madam, by my soul,"
The Merchant of Venice,5,1,BASSANIO,2,"No woman had it, but a civil doctor,"
The Merchant of Venice,5,1,BASSANIO,3,Which did refuse three thousand ducats of me
The Merchant of Venice,5,1,BASSANIO,4,And begg'd the ring; the which I did deny him
The Merchant of Venice,5,1,BASSANIO,5,And suffer'd him to go displeased away;
The Merchant of Venice,5,1,BASSANIO,6,Even he that did uphold the very life
The Merchant of Venice,5,1,BASSANIO,7,"Of my dear friend. What should I say, sweet lady?"
The Merchant of Venice,5,1,BASSANIO,8,I was enforced to send it after him;
The Merchant of Venice,5,1,BASSANIO,9,I was beset with shame and courtesy;
The Merchant of Venice,5,1,BASSANIO,10,My honour would not let ingratitude
The Merchant of Venice,5,1,BASSANIO,11,"So much besmear it. Pardon me, good lady;"
The Merchant of Venice,5,1,BASSANIO,12,"For, by these blessed candles of the night,"
The Merchant of Venice,5,1,BASSANIO,13,"Had you been there, I think you would have begg'd"
The Merchant of Venice,5,1,BASSANIO,14,The ring of me to give the worthy doctor.
The Merchant of Venice,5,1,PORTIA,1,Let not that doctor e'er come near my house:
The Merchant of Venice,5,1,PORTIA,2,"Since he hath got the jewel that I loved,"
The Merchant of Venice,5,1,PORTIA,3,"And that which you did swear to keep for me,"
The Merchant of Venice,5,1,PORTIA,4,I will become as liberal as you;
The Merchant of Venice,5,1,PORTIA,5,"I'll not deny him any thing I have,"
The Merchant of Venice,5,1,PORTIA,6,"No, not my body nor my husband's bed:"
The Merchant of Venice,5,1,PORTIA,7,"Know him I shall, I am well sure of it:"
The Merchant of Venice,5,1,PORTIA,8,Lie not a night from home; watch me like Argus:
The Merchant of Venice,5,1,PORTIA,9,"If you do not, if I be left alone,"
The Merchant of Venice,5,1,PORTIA,10,"Now, by mine honour, which is yet mine own,"
The Merchant of Venice,5,1,PORTIA,11,I'll have that doctor for my bedfellow.
The Merchant of Venice,5,1,NERISSA,1,And I his clerk; therefore be well advised
The Merchant of Venice,5,1,NERISSA,2,How you do leave me to mine own protection.
The Merchant of Venice,5,1,GRATIANO,1,"Well, do you so; let not me take him, then;"
The Merchant of Venice,5,1,GRATIANO,2,"For if I do, I'll mar the young clerk's pen."
The Merchant of Venice,5,1,ANTONIO,1,I am the unhappy subject of these quarrels.
The Merchant of Venice,5,1,PORTIA,1,"Sir, grieve not you; you are welcome notwithstanding."
The Merchant of Venice,5,1,BASSANIO,1,"Portia, forgive me this enforced wrong;"
The Merchant of Venice,5,1,BASSANIO,2,"And, in the hearing of these many friends,"
The Merchant of Venice,5,1,BASSANIO,3,"I swear to thee, even by thine own fair eyes,"
The Merchant of Venice,5,1,BASSANIO,4,Wherein I see myself--
The Merchant of Venice,5,1,PORTIA,1,Mark you but that!
The Merchant of Venice,5,1,PORTIA,2,In both my eyes he doubly sees himself;
The Merchant of Venice,5,1,PORTIA,3,"In each eye, one: swear by your double self,"
The Merchant of Venice,5,1,PORTIA,4,And there's an oath of credit.
The Merchant of Venice,5,1,BASSANIO,1,"Nay, but hear me:"
The Merchant of Venice,5,1,BASSANIO,2,"Pardon this fault, and by my soul I swear"
The Merchant of Venice,5,1,BASSANIO,3,I never more will break an oath with thee.
The Merchant of Venice,5,1,ANTONIO,1,I once did lend my body for his wealth;
The Merchant of Venice,5,1,ANTONIO,2,"Which, but for him that had your husband's ring,"
The Merchant of Venice,5,1,ANTONIO,3,"Had quite miscarried: I dare be bound again,"
The Merchant of Venice,5,1,ANTONIO,4,"My soul upon the forfeit, that your lord"
The Merchant of Venice,5,1,ANTONIO,5,Will never more break faith advisedly.
The Merchant of Venice,5,1,PORTIA,1,Then you shall be his surety. Give him this
The Merchant of Venice,5,1,PORTIA,2,And bid him keep it better than the other.
The Merchant of Venice,5,1,ANTONIO,1,"Here, Lord Bassanio; swear to keep this ring."
The Merchant of Venice,5,1,BASSANIO,1,"By heaven, it is the same I gave the doctor!"
The Merchant of Venice,5,1,PORTIA,1,"I had it of him: pardon me, Bassanio;"
The Merchant of Venice,5,1,PORTIA,2,"For, by this ring, the doctor lay with me."
The Merchant of Venice,5,1,NERISSA,1,"And pardon me, my gentle Gratiano;"
The Merchant of Venice,5,1,NERISSA,2,"For that same scrubbed boy, the doctor's clerk,"
The Merchant of Venice,5,1,NERISSA,3,In lieu of this last night did lie with me.
The Merchant of Venice,5,1,GRATIANO,1,"Why, this is like the mending of highways"
The Merchant of Venice,5,1,GRATIANO,2,"In summer, where the ways are fair enough:"
The Merchant of Venice,5,1,GRATIANO,3,"What, are we cuckolds ere we have deserved it?"
The Merchant of Venice,5,1,PORTIA,1,Speak not so grossly. You are all amazed:
The Merchant of Venice,5,1,PORTIA,2,Here is a letter; read it at your leisure;
The Merchant of Venice,5,1,PORTIA,3,"It comes from Padua, from Bellario:"
The Merchant of Venice,5,1,PORTIA,4,"There you shall find that Portia was the doctor,"
The Merchant of Venice,5,1,PORTIA,5,Nerissa there her clerk: Lorenzo here
The Merchant of Venice,5,1,PORTIA,6,Shall witness I set forth as soon as you
The Merchant of Venice,5,1,PORTIA,7,And even but now return'd; I have not yet
The Merchant of Venice,5,1,PORTIA,8,"Enter'd my house. Antonio, you are welcome;"
The Merchant of Venice,5,1,PORTIA,9,And I have better news in store for you
The Merchant of Venice,5,1,PORTIA,10,Than you expect: unseal this letter soon;
The Merchant of Venice,5,1,PORTIA,11,There you shall find three of your argosies
The Merchant of Venice,5,1,PORTIA,12,Are richly come to harbour suddenly:
The Merchant of Venice,5,1,PORTIA,13,You shall not know by what strange accident
The Merchant of Venice,5,1,PORTIA,14,I chanced on this letter.
The Merchant of Venice,5,1,ANTONIO,1,I am dumb.
The Merchant of Venice,5,1,BASSANIO,1,Were you the doctor and I knew you not?
The Merchant of Venice,5,1,GRATIANO,1,Were you the clerk that is to make me cuckold?
The Merchant of Venice,5,1,NERISSA,1,"Ay, but the clerk that never means to do it,"
The Merchant of Venice,5,1,NERISSA,2,Unless he live until he be a man.
The Merchant of Venice,5,1,BASSANIO,1,"Sweet doctor, you shall be my bed-fellow:"
The Merchant of Venice,5,1,BASSANIO,2,"When I am absent, then lie with my wife."
The Merchant of Venice,5,1,ANTONIO,1,"Sweet lady, you have given me life and living;"
The Merchant of Venice,5,1,ANTONIO,2,For here I read for certain that my ships
The Merchant of Venice,5,1,ANTONIO,3,Are safely come to road.
The Merchant of Venice,5,1,PORTIA,1,"How now, Lorenzo!"
The Merchant of Venice,5,1,PORTIA,2,My clerk hath some good comforts too for you.
The Merchant of Venice,5,1,NERISSA,1,"Ay, and I'll give them him without a fee."
The Merchant of Venice,5,1,NERISSA,2,"There do I give to you and Jessica,"
The Merchant of Venice,5,1,NERISSA,3,"From the rich Jew, a special deed of gift,"
The Merchant of Venice,5,1,NERISSA,4,"After his death, of all he dies possess'd of."
The Merchant of Venice,5,1,LORENZO,1,"Fair ladies, you drop manna in the way"
The Merchant of Venice,5,1,LORENZO,2,Of starved people.
The Merchant of Venice,5,1,PORTIA,1,"It is almost morning,"
The Merchant of Venice,5,1,PORTIA,2,And yet I am sure you are not satisfied
The Merchant of Venice,5,1,PORTIA,3,Of these events at full. Let us go in;
The Merchant of Venice,5,1,PORTIA,4,"And charge us there upon inter'gatories,"
The Merchant of Venice,5,1,PORTIA,5,And we will answer all things faithfully.
The Merchant of Venice,5,1,GRATIANO,1,Let it be so: the first inter'gatory
The Merchant of Venice,5,1,GRATIANO,2,"That my Nerissa shall be sworn on is,"
The Merchant of Venice,5,1,GRATIANO,3,"Whether till the next night she had rather stay,"
The Merchant of Venice,5,1,GRATIANO,4,"Or go to bed now, being two hours to day:"
The Merchant of Venice,5,1,GRATIANO,5,"But were the day come, I should wish it dark,"
The Merchant of Venice,5,1,GRATIANO,6,That I were couching with the doctor's clerk.
The Merchant of Venice,5,1,GRATIANO,7,"Well, while I live I'll fear no other thing"
The Merchant of Venice,5,1,GRATIANO,8,So sore as keeping safe Nerissa's ring.
