The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,1,1,SAMPSON,1,"Gregory, o' my word, we'll not carry coals."
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,1,1,GREGORY,1,"No, for then we should be colliers."
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,1,1,SAMPSON,1,"I mean, an we be in choler, we'll draw."
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,1,1,GREGORY,1,"Ay, while you live, draw your neck out o' the collar."
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,1,1,SAMPSON,1,"I strike quickly, being moved."
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,1,1,GREGORY,1,But thou art not quickly moved to strike.
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,1,1,SAMPSON,1,A dog of the house of Montague moves me.
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,1,1,GREGORY,1,To move is to stir; and to be valiant is to stand:
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,1,1,GREGORY,2,"therefore, if thou art moved, thou runn'st away."
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,1,1,SAMPSON,1,A dog of that house shall move me to stand: I will
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,1,1,SAMPSON,2,take the wall of any man or maid of Montague's.
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,1,1,GREGORY,1,That shows thee a weak slave; for the weakest goes
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,1,1,GREGORY,2,to the wall.
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,1,1,SAMPSON,1,"True; and therefore women, being the weaker vessels,"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,1,1,SAMPSON,2,are ever thrust to the wall: therefore I will push
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,1,1,SAMPSON,3,"Montague's men from the wall, and thrust his maids"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,1,1,SAMPSON,4,to the wall.
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,1,1,GREGORY,1,The quarrel is between our masters and us their men.
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,1,1,SAMPSON,1,"'Tis all one, I will show myself a tyrant: when I"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,1,1,SAMPSON,2,"have fought with the men, I will be cruel with the"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,1,1,SAMPSON,3,"maids, and cut off their heads."
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,1,1,GREGORY,1,The heads of the maids?
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,1,1,SAMPSON,1,"Ay, the heads of the maids, or their maidenheads;"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,1,1,SAMPSON,2,take it in what sense thou wilt.
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,1,1,GREGORY,1,They must take it in sense that feel it.
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,1,1,SAMPSON,1,Me they shall feel while I am able to stand: and
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,1,1,SAMPSON,2,'tis known I am a pretty piece of flesh.
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,1,1,GREGORY,1,"'Tis well thou art not fish; if thou hadst, thou"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,1,1,GREGORY,2,hadst been poor John. Draw thy tool! here comes
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,1,1,GREGORY,3,two of the house of the Montagues.
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,1,1,SAMPSON,1,"My naked weapon is out: quarrel, I will back thee."
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,1,1,GREGORY,1,How! turn thy back and run?
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,1,1,SAMPSON,1,Fear me not.
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,1,1,GREGORY,1,"No, marry; I fear thee!"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,1,1,SAMPSON,1,Let us take the law of our sides; let them begin.
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,1,1,GREGORY,1,"I will frown as I pass by, and let them take it as"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,1,1,GREGORY,2,they list.
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,1,1,SAMPSON,1,"Nay, as they dare. I will bite my thumb at them;"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,1,1,SAMPSON,2,"which is a disgrace to them, if they bear it."
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,1,1,ABRAHAM,1,"Do you bite your thumb at us, sir?"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,1,1,SAMPSON,1,"I do bite my thumb, sir."
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,1,1,ABRAHAM,1,"Do you bite your thumb at us, sir?"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,1,1,SAMPSON,1,ay?
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,1,1,GREGORY,1,No.
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,1,1,SAMPSON,1,"No, sir, I do not bite my thumb at you, sir, but I"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,1,1,SAMPSON,2,"bite my thumb, sir."
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,1,1,GREGORY,1,"Do you quarrel, sir?"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,1,1,ABRAHAM,1,"Quarrel sir! no, sir."
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,1,1,SAMPSON,1,"If you do, sir, I am for you: I serve as good a man as you."
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,1,1,ABRAHAM,1,No better.
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,1,1,SAMPSON,1,"Well, sir."
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,1,1,GREGORY,1,Say 'better:' here comes one of my master's kinsmen.
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,1,1,SAMPSON,1,"Yes, better, sir."
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,1,1,ABRAHAM,1,You lie.
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,1,1,SAMPSON,1,"Draw, if you be men. Gregory, remember thy swashing blow."
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,1,1,BENVOLIO,1,"Part, fools!"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,1,1,BENVOLIO,2,Put up your swords; you know not what you do.
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,1,1,TYBALT,1,"What, art thou drawn among these heartless hinds?"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,1,1,TYBALT,2,"Turn thee, Benvolio, look upon thy death."
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,1,1,BENVOLIO,1,"I do but keep the peace: put up thy sword,"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,1,1,BENVOLIO,2,Or manage it to part these men with me.
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,1,1,TYBALT,1,"What, drawn, and talk of peace! I hate the word,"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,1,1,TYBALT,2,"As I hate hell, all Montagues, and thee:"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,1,1,TYBALT,3,"Have at thee, coward!"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,1,1,FIRST CITIZEN,1,"Clubs, bills, and partisans! strike! beat them down!"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,1,1,FIRST CITIZEN,2,Down with the Capulets! down with the Montagues!
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,1,1,CAPULET,1,"What noise is this? Give me my long sword, ho!"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,1,1,LADY CAPULET,1,"A crutch, a crutch! why call you for a sword?"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,1,1,CAPULET,1,"My sword, I say! Old Montague is come,"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,1,1,CAPULET,2,And flourishes his blade in spite of me.
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,1,1,MONTAGUE,1,"Thou villain Capulet,--Hold me not, let me go."
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,1,1,LADY MONTAGUE,1,Thou shalt not stir a foot to seek a foe.
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,1,1,PRINCE,1,"Rebellious subjects, enemies to peace,"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,1,1,PRINCE,2,"Profaners of this neighbour-stained steel,--"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,1,1,PRINCE,3,"Will they not hear? What, ho! you men, you beasts,"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,1,1,PRINCE,4,That quench the fire of your pernicious rage
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,1,1,PRINCE,5,"With purple fountains issuing from your veins,"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,1,1,PRINCE,6,"On pain of torture, from those bloody hands"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,1,1,PRINCE,7,"Throw your mistemper'd weapons to the ground,"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,1,1,PRINCE,8,And hear the sentence of your moved prince.
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,1,1,PRINCE,9,"Three civil brawls, bred of an airy word,"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,1,1,PRINCE,10,"By thee, old Capulet, and Montague,"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,1,1,PRINCE,11,"Have thrice disturb'd the quiet of our streets,"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,1,1,PRINCE,12,And made Verona's ancient citizens
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,1,1,PRINCE,13,"Cast by their grave beseeming ornaments,"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,1,1,PRINCE,14,"To wield old partisans, in hands as old,"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,1,1,PRINCE,15,"Canker'd with peace, to part your canker'd hate:"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,1,1,PRINCE,16,"If ever you disturb our streets again,"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,1,1,PRINCE,17,Your lives shall pay the forfeit of the peace.
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,1,1,PRINCE,18,"For this time, all the rest depart away:"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,1,1,PRINCE,19,You Capulet; shall go along with me:
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,1,1,PRINCE,20,"And, Montague, come you this afternoon,"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,1,1,PRINCE,21,"To know our further pleasure in this case,"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,1,1,PRINCE,22,"To old Free-town, our common judgment-place."
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,1,1,PRINCE,23,"Once more, on pain of death, all men depart."
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,1,1,MONTAGUE,1,Who set this ancient quarrel new abroach?
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,1,1,MONTAGUE,2,"Speak, nephew, were you by when it began?"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,1,1,BENVOLIO,1,"Here were the servants of your adversary,"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,1,1,BENVOLIO,2,"And yours, close fighting ere I did approach:"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,1,1,BENVOLIO,3,I drew to part them: in the instant came
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,1,1,BENVOLIO,4,"The fiery Tybalt, with his sword prepared,"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,1,1,BENVOLIO,5,"Which, as he breathed defiance to my ears,"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,1,1,BENVOLIO,6,"He swung about his head and cut the winds,"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,1,1,BENVOLIO,7,Who nothing hurt withal hiss'd him in scorn:
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,1,1,BENVOLIO,8,"While we were interchanging thrusts and blows,"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,1,1,BENVOLIO,9,"Came more and more and fought on part and part,"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,1,1,BENVOLIO,10,"Till the prince came, who parted either part."
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,1,1,LADY MONTAGUE,1,"O, where is Romeo? saw you him to-day?"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,1,1,LADY MONTAGUE,2,Right glad I am he was not at this fray.
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,1,1,BENVOLIO,1,"Madam, an hour before the worshipp'd sun"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,1,1,BENVOLIO,2,"Peer'd forth the golden window of the east,"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,1,1,BENVOLIO,3,A troubled mind drave me to walk abroad;
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,1,1,BENVOLIO,4,"Where, underneath the grove of sycamore"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,1,1,BENVOLIO,5,"That westward rooteth from the city's side,"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,1,1,BENVOLIO,6,So early walking did I see your son:
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,1,1,BENVOLIO,7,"Towards him I made, but he was ware of me"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,1,1,BENVOLIO,8,And stole into the covert of the wood:
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,1,1,BENVOLIO,9,"I, measuring his affections by my own,"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,1,1,BENVOLIO,10,"That most are busied when they're most alone,"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,1,1,BENVOLIO,11,"Pursued my humour not pursuing his,"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,1,1,BENVOLIO,12,And gladly shunn'd who gladly fled from me.
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,1,1,MONTAGUE,1,"Many a morning hath he there been seen,"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,1,1,MONTAGUE,2,With tears augmenting the fresh morning dew.
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,1,1,MONTAGUE,3,Adding to clouds more clouds with his deep sighs;
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,1,1,MONTAGUE,4,But all so soon as the all-cheering sun
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,1,1,MONTAGUE,5,Should in the furthest east begin to draw
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,1,1,MONTAGUE,6,"The shady curtains from Aurora's bed,"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,1,1,MONTAGUE,7,"Away from the light steals home my heavy son,"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,1,1,MONTAGUE,8,"And private in his chamber pens himself,"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,1,1,MONTAGUE,9,"Shuts up his windows, locks far daylight out"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,1,1,MONTAGUE,10,And makes himself an artificial night:
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,1,1,MONTAGUE,11,"Black and portentous must this humour prove,"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,1,1,MONTAGUE,12,Unless good counsel may the cause remove.
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,1,1,BENVOLIO,1,"My noble uncle, do you know the cause?"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,1,1,MONTAGUE,1,I neither know it nor can learn of him.
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,1,1,BENVOLIO,1,Have you importuned him by any means?
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,1,1,MONTAGUE,1,Both by myself and many other friends:
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,1,1,MONTAGUE,2,"But he, his own affections' counsellor,"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,1,1,MONTAGUE,3,Is to himself--I will not say how true--
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,1,1,MONTAGUE,4,"But to himself so secret and so close,"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,1,1,MONTAGUE,5,"So far from sounding and discovery,"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,1,1,MONTAGUE,6,"As is the bud bit with an envious worm,"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,1,1,MONTAGUE,7,"Ere he can spread his sweet leaves to the air,"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,1,1,MONTAGUE,8,Or dedicate his beauty to the sun.
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,1,1,MONTAGUE,9,Could we but learn from whence his sorrows grow.
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,1,1,MONTAGUE,10,We would as willingly give cure as know.
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,1,1,BENVOLIO,1,"See, where he comes: so please you, step aside;"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,1,1,BENVOLIO,2,"I'll know his grievance, or be much denied."
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,1,1,MONTAGUE,1,"I would thou wert so happy by thy stay,"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,1,1,MONTAGUE,2,"To hear true shrift. Come, madam, let's away."
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,1,1,BENVOLIO,1,"Good-morrow, cousin."
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,1,1,ROMEO,1,Is the day so young?
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,1,1,BENVOLIO,1,But new struck nine.
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,1,1,ROMEO,1,Ay me! sad hours seem long.
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,1,1,ROMEO,2,Was that my father that went hence so fast?
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,1,1,BENVOLIO,1,It was. What sadness lengthens Romeo's hours?
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,1,1,ROMEO,1,"Not having that, which, having, makes them short."
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,1,1,BENVOLIO,1,In love?
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,1,1,ROMEO,1,Out--
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,1,1,BENVOLIO,1,Of love?
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,1,1,ROMEO,1,"Out of her favour, where I am in love."
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,1,1,BENVOLIO,1,"Alas, that love, so gentle in his view,"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,1,1,BENVOLIO,2,Should be so tyrannous and rough in proof!
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,1,1,ROMEO,1,"Alas, that love, whose view is muffled still,"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,1,1,ROMEO,2,"Should, without eyes, see pathways to his will!"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,1,1,ROMEO,3,Where shall we dine? O me! What fray was here?
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,1,1,ROMEO,4,"Yet tell me not, for I have heard it all."
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,1,1,ROMEO,5,"Here's much to do with hate, but more with love."
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,1,1,ROMEO,6,"Why, then, O brawling love! O loving hate!"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,1,1,ROMEO,7,"O any thing, of nothing first create!"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,1,1,ROMEO,8,O heavy lightness! serious vanity!
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,1,1,ROMEO,9,Mis-shapen chaos of well-seeming forms!
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,1,1,ROMEO,10,"Feather of lead, bright smoke, cold fire,"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,1,1,ROMEO,11,sick health!
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,1,1,ROMEO,12,"Still-waking sleep, that is not what it is!"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,1,1,ROMEO,13,"This love feel I, that feel no love in this."
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,1,1,ROMEO,14,Dost thou not laugh?
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,1,1,BENVOLIO,1,"No, coz, I rather weep."
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,1,1,ROMEO,1,"Good heart, at what?"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,1,1,BENVOLIO,1,At thy good heart's oppression.
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,1,1,ROMEO,1,"Why, such is love's transgression."
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,1,1,ROMEO,2,"Griefs of mine own lie heavy in my breast,"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,1,1,ROMEO,3,"Which thou wilt propagate, to have it prest"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,1,1,ROMEO,4,With more of thine: this love that thou hast shown
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,1,1,ROMEO,5,Doth add more grief to too much of mine own.
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,1,1,ROMEO,6,Love is a smoke raised with the fume of sighs;
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,1,1,ROMEO,7,"Being purged, a fire sparkling in lovers' eyes;"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,1,1,ROMEO,8,Being vex'd a sea nourish'd with lovers' tears:
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,1,1,ROMEO,9,"What is it else? a madness most discreet,"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,1,1,ROMEO,10,A choking gall and a preserving sweet.
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,1,1,ROMEO,11,"Farewell, my coz."
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,1,1,BENVOLIO,1,Soft! I will go along;
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,1,1,BENVOLIO,2,"An if you leave me so, you do me wrong."
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,1,1,ROMEO,1,"Tut, I have lost myself; I am not here;"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,1,1,ROMEO,2,"This is not Romeo, he's some other where."
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,1,1,BENVOLIO,1,"Tell me in sadness, who is that you love."
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,1,1,ROMEO,1,"What, shall I groan and tell thee?"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,1,1,BENVOLIO,1,"Groan! why, no."
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,1,1,BENVOLIO,2,But sadly tell me who.
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,1,1,ROMEO,1,Bid a sick man in sadness make his will:
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,1,1,ROMEO,2,"Ah, word ill urged to one that is so ill!"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,1,1,ROMEO,3,"In sadness, cousin, I do love a woman."
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,1,1,BENVOLIO,1,"I aim'd so near, when I supposed you loved."
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,1,1,ROMEO,1,A right good mark-man! And she's fair I love.
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,1,1,BENVOLIO,1,"A right fair mark, fair coz, is soonest hit."
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,1,1,ROMEO,1,"Well, in that hit you miss: she'll not be hit"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,1,1,ROMEO,2,With Cupid's arrow; she hath Dian's wit;
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,1,1,ROMEO,3,"And, in strong proof of chastity well arm'd,"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,1,1,ROMEO,4,From love's weak childish bow she lives unharm'd.
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,1,1,ROMEO,5,"She will not stay the siege of loving terms,"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,1,1,ROMEO,6,"Nor bide the encounter of assailing eyes,"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,1,1,ROMEO,7,Nor ope her lap to saint-seducing gold:
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,1,1,ROMEO,8,"O, she is rich in beauty, only poor,"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,1,1,ROMEO,9,That when she dies with beauty dies her store.
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,1,1,BENVOLIO,1,Then she hath sworn that she will still live chaste?
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,1,1,ROMEO,1,"She hath, and in that sparing makes huge waste,"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,1,1,ROMEO,2,For beauty starved with her severity
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,1,1,ROMEO,3,Cuts beauty off from all posterity.
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,1,1,ROMEO,4,"She is too fair, too wise, wisely too fair,"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,1,1,ROMEO,5,To merit bliss by making me despair:
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,1,1,ROMEO,6,"She hath forsworn to love, and in that vow"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,1,1,ROMEO,7,Do I live dead that live to tell it now.
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,1,1,BENVOLIO,1,"Be ruled by me, forget to think of her."
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,1,1,ROMEO,1,"O, teach me how I should forget to think."
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,1,1,BENVOLIO,1,By giving liberty unto thine eyes;
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,1,1,BENVOLIO,2,Examine other beauties.
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,1,1,ROMEO,1,'Tis the way
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,1,1,ROMEO,2,"To call hers exquisite, in question more:"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,1,1,ROMEO,3,These happy masks that kiss fair ladies' brows
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,1,1,ROMEO,4,Being black put us in mind they hide the fair;
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,1,1,ROMEO,5,He that is strucken blind cannot forget
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,1,1,ROMEO,6,The precious treasure of his eyesight lost:
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,1,1,ROMEO,7,"Show me a mistress that is passing fair,"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,1,1,ROMEO,8,"What doth her beauty serve, but as a note"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,1,1,ROMEO,9,Where I may read who pass'd that passing fair?
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,1,1,ROMEO,10,Farewell: thou canst not teach me to forget.
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,1,1,BENVOLIO,1,"I'll pay that doctrine, or else die in debt."
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,1,2,CAPULET,1,"But Montague is bound as well as I,"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,1,2,CAPULET,2,"In penalty alike; and 'tis not hard, I think,"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,1,2,CAPULET,3,For men so old as we to keep the peace.
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,1,2,PARIS,1,Of honourable reckoning are you both;
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,1,2,PARIS,2,And pity 'tis you lived at odds so long.
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,1,2,PARIS,3,"But now, my lord, what say you to my suit?"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,1,2,CAPULET,1,But saying o'er what I have said before:
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,1,2,CAPULET,2,My child is yet a stranger in the world;
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,1,2,CAPULET,3,"She hath not seen the change of fourteen years,"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,1,2,CAPULET,4,"Let two more summers wither in their pride,"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,1,2,CAPULET,5,Ere we may think her ripe to be a bride.
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,1,2,PARIS,1,Younger than she are happy mothers made.
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,1,2,CAPULET,1,And too soon marr'd are those so early made.
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,1,2,CAPULET,2,"The earth hath swallow'd all my hopes but she,"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,1,2,CAPULET,3,She is the hopeful lady of my earth:
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,1,2,CAPULET,4,"But woo her, gentle Paris, get her heart,"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,1,2,CAPULET,5,My will to her consent is but a part;
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,1,2,CAPULET,6,"An she agree, within her scope of choice"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,1,2,CAPULET,7,Lies my consent and fair according voice.
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,1,2,CAPULET,8,"This night I hold an old accustom'd feast,"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,1,2,CAPULET,9,"Whereto I have invited many a guest,"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,1,2,CAPULET,10,"Such as I love; and you, among the store,"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,1,2,CAPULET,11,"One more, most welcome, makes my number more."
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,1,2,CAPULET,12,At my poor house look to behold this night
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,1,2,CAPULET,13,Earth-treading stars that make dark heaven light:
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,1,2,CAPULET,14,Such comfort as do lusty young men feel
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,1,2,CAPULET,15,When well-apparell'd April on the heel
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,1,2,CAPULET,16,"Of limping winter treads, even such delight"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,1,2,CAPULET,17,Among fresh female buds shall you this night
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,1,2,CAPULET,18,"Inherit at my house; hear all, all see,"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,1,2,CAPULET,19,And like her most whose merit most shall be:
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,1,2,CAPULET,20,"Which on more view, of many mine being one"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,1,2,CAPULET,21,"May stand in number, though in reckoning none,"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,1,2,CAPULET,22,"Come, go with me."
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,1,2,CAPULET,23,"Go, sirrah, trudge about"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,1,2,CAPULET,24,Through fair Verona; find those persons out
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,1,2,CAPULET,25,"Whose names are written there, and to them say,"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,1,2,CAPULET,26,My house and welcome on their pleasure stay.
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,1,2,SERVANT,1,Find them out whose names are written here! It is
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,1,2,SERVANT,2,"written, that the shoemaker should meddle with his"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,1,2,SERVANT,3,"yard, and the tailor with his last, the fisher with"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,1,2,SERVANT,4,"his pencil, and the painter with his nets; but I am"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,1,2,SERVANT,5,sent to find those persons whose names are here
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,1,2,SERVANT,6,"writ, and can never find what names the writing"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,1,2,SERVANT,7,person hath here writ. I must to the learned.--In good time.

The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,1,3,NURSE,11,"For I had then laid wormwood to my dug,"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,1,3,NURSE,12,Sitting in the sun under the dove-house wall;
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,1,3,NURSE,13,My lord and you were then at Mantua:--
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,1,3,NURSE,14,"Nay, I do bear a brain:--but, as I said,"

The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,1,3,NURSE,25,A' was a merry man--took up the child:
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,1,3,NURSE,26,"'Yea,' quoth he, 'dost thou fall upon thy face?"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,1,3,NURSE,27,Thou wilt fall backward when thou hast more wit;
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,1,3,NURSE,28,"Wilt thou not, Jule?' and, by my holidame,"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,1,3,NURSE,29,The pretty wretch left crying and said 'Ay.'

The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,1,3,NURSE,7,Thou wilt fall backward when thou comest to age;

The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,1,3,JULIET,1,It is an honour that I dream not of.
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,1,3,NURSE,1,"An honour! were not I thine only nurse,"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,1,3,NURSE,2,I would say thou hadst suck'd wisdom from thy teat.
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,1,3,LADY CAPULET,1,"Well, think of marriage now; younger than you,"

The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,1,3,NURSE,1,"A man, young lady! lady, such a man"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,1,3,NURSE,2,"As all the world--why, he's a man of wax."
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,1,3,LADY CAPULET,1,Verona's summer hath not such a flower.
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,1,3,NURSE,1,"Nay, he's a flower; in faith, a very flower."
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,1,3,LADY CAPULET,1,What say you? can you love the gentleman?
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,1,3,LADY CAPULET,2,This night you shall behold him at our feast;
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,1,3,LADY CAPULET,3,"Read o'er the volume of young Paris' face,"

The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,1,3,LADY CAPULET,9,"This precious book of love, this unbound lover,"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,1,3,LADY CAPULET,10,"To beautify him, only lacks a cover:"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,1,3,LADY CAPULET,11,"The fish lives in the sea, and 'tis much pride"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,1,3,LADY CAPULET,12,For fair without the fair within to hide:
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,1,3,LADY CAPULET,13,"That book in many's eyes doth share the glory,"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,1,3,LADY CAPULET,14,That in gold clasps locks in the golden story;
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,1,3,LADY CAPULET,15,"So shall you share all that he doth possess,"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,1,3,LADY CAPULET,16,"By having him, making yourself no less."
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,1,3,NURSE,1,"No less! nay, bigger; women grow by men."

The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,1,3,JULIET,1,"I'll look to like, if looking liking move:"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,1,3,JULIET,2,But no more deep will I endart mine eye
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,1,3,JULIET,3,Than your consent gives strength to make it fly.
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,1,3,SERVANT,1,"Madam, the guests are come, supper served up, you"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,1,3,SERVANT,2,"called, my young lady asked for, the nurse cursed in"

The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,1,3,SERVANT,4,"hence to wait; I beseech you, follow straight."
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,1,3,LADY CAPULET,1,We follow thee.
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,1,3,LADY CAPULET,2,"Juliet, the county stays."
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,1,3,NURSE,1,"Go, girl, seek happy nights to happy days."
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,1,4,ROMEO,1,"What, shall this speech be spoke for our excuse?"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,1,4,ROMEO,2,Or shall we on without a apology?
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,1,4,BENVOLIO,1,The date is out of such prolixity:
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,1,4,BENVOLIO,2,"We'll have no Cupid hoodwink'd with a scarf,"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,1,4,BENVOLIO,3,"Bearing a Tartar's painted bow of lath,"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,1,4,BENVOLIO,4,Scaring the ladies like a crow-keeper;
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,1,4,BENVOLIO,5,"Nor no without-book prologue, faintly spoke"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,1,4,BENVOLIO,6,"After the prompter, for our entrance:"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,1,4,BENVOLIO,7,But let them measure us by what they will;
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,1,4,BENVOLIO,8,"We'll measure them a measure, and be gone."
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,1,4,ROMEO,1,Give me a torch: I am not for this ambling;
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,1,4,ROMEO,2,"Being but heavy, I will bear the light."
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,1,4,MERCUTIO,1,"Nay, gentle Romeo, we must have you dance."
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,1,4,ROMEO,1,"Not I, believe me: you have dancing shoes"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,1,4,ROMEO,2,With nimble soles: I have a soul of lead
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,1,4,ROMEO,3,So stakes me to the ground I cannot move.
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,1,4,MERCUTIO,1,"You are a lover; borrow Cupid's wings,"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,1,4,MERCUTIO,2,And soar with them above a common bound.
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,1,4,ROMEO,1,I am too sore enpierced with his shaft
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,1,4,ROMEO,2,"To soar with his light feathers, and so bound,"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,1,4,ROMEO,3,I cannot bound a pitch above dull woe:
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,1,4,ROMEO,4,Under love's heavy burden do I sink.
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,1,4,MERCUTIO,1,"And, to sink in it, should you burden love;"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,1,4,MERCUTIO,2,Too great oppression for a tender thing.
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,1,4,ROMEO,1,"Is love a tender thing? it is too rough,"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,1,4,ROMEO,2,"Too rude, too boisterous, and it pricks like thorn."
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,1,4,MERCUTIO,1,"If love be rough with you, be rough with love;"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,1,4,MERCUTIO,2,"Prick love for pricking, and you beat love down."
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,1,4,MERCUTIO,3,Give me a case to put my visage in:
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,1,4,MERCUTIO,4,A visor for a visor! what care I
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,1,4,MERCUTIO,5,What curious eye doth quote deformities?
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,1,4,MERCUTIO,6,Here are the beetle brows shall blush for me.
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,1,4,BENVOLIO,1,"Come, knock and enter; and no sooner in,"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,1,4,BENVOLIO,2,But every man betake him to his legs.
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,1,4,ROMEO,1,A torch for me: let wantons light of heart
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,1,4,ROMEO,2,"Tickle the senseless rushes with their heels,"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,1,4,ROMEO,3,For I am proverb'd with a grandsire phrase;
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,1,4,ROMEO,4,"I'll be a candle-holder, and look on."
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,1,4,ROMEO,5,"The game was ne'er so fair, and I am done."
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,1,4,MERCUTIO,1,"Tut, dun's the mouse, the constable's own word:"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,1,4,MERCUTIO,2,"If thou art dun, we'll draw thee from the mire"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,1,4,MERCUTIO,3,"Of this sir-reverence love, wherein thou stick'st"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,1,4,MERCUTIO,4,"Up to the ears. Come, we burn daylight, ho!"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,1,4,ROMEO,1,"Nay, that's not so."
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,1,4,MERCUTIO,1,"I mean, sir, in delay"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,1,4,MERCUTIO,2,"We waste our lights in vain, like lamps by day."
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,1,4,MERCUTIO,3,"Take our good meaning, for our judgment sits"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,1,4,MERCUTIO,4,Five times in that ere once in our five wits.
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,1,4,ROMEO,1,And we mean well in going to this mask;
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,1,4,ROMEO,2,But 'tis no wit to go.
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,1,4,MERCUTIO,1,"Why, may one ask?"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,1,4,ROMEO,1,I dream'd a dream to-night.
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,1,4,MERCUTIO,1,And so did I.
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,1,4,ROMEO,1,"Well, what was yours?"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,1,4,MERCUTIO,1,That dreamers often lie.
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,1,4,ROMEO,1,"In bed asleep, while they do dream things true."
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,1,4,MERCUTIO,1,"O, then, I see Queen Mab hath been with you."
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,1,4,MERCUTIO,2,"She is the fairies' midwife, and she comes"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,1,4,MERCUTIO,3,In shape no bigger than an agate-stone
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,1,4,MERCUTIO,4,"On the fore-finger of an alderman,"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,1,4,MERCUTIO,5,Drawn with a team of little atomies
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,1,4,MERCUTIO,6,Athwart men's noses as they lie asleep;
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,1,4,MERCUTIO,7,"Her wagon-spokes made of long spiders' legs,"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,1,4,MERCUTIO,8,"The cover of the wings of grasshoppers,"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,1,4,MERCUTIO,9,"The traces of the smallest spider's web,"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,1,4,MERCUTIO,10,"The collars of the moonshine's watery beams,"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,1,4,MERCUTIO,11,"Her whip of cricket's bone, the lash of film,"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,1,4,MERCUTIO,12,"Her wagoner a small grey-coated gnat,"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,1,4,MERCUTIO,13,Not so big as a round little worm
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,1,4,MERCUTIO,14,Prick'd from the lazy finger of a maid;
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,1,4,MERCUTIO,15,Her chariot is an empty hazel-nut
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,1,4,MERCUTIO,16,"Made by the joiner squirrel or old grub,"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,1,4,MERCUTIO,17,Time out o' mind the fairies' coachmakers.
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,1,4,MERCUTIO,18,And in this state she gallops night by night
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,1,4,MERCUTIO,19,"Through lovers' brains, and then they dream of love;"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,1,4,MERCUTIO,20,"O'er courtiers' knees, that dream on court'sies straight,"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,1,4,MERCUTIO,21,"O'er lawyers' fingers, who straight dream on fees,"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,1,4,MERCUTIO,22,"O'er ladies ' lips, who straight on kisses dream,"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,1,4,MERCUTIO,23,"Which oft the angry Mab with blisters plagues,"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,1,4,MERCUTIO,24,Because their breaths with sweetmeats tainted are:
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,1,4,MERCUTIO,25,"Sometime she gallops o'er a courtier's nose,"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,1,4,MERCUTIO,26,And then dreams he of smelling out a suit;
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,1,4,MERCUTIO,27,And sometime comes she with a tithe-pig's tail
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,1,4,MERCUTIO,28,"Tickling a parson's nose as a' lies asleep,"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,1,4,MERCUTIO,29,"Then dreams, he of another benefice:"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,1,4,MERCUTIO,30,"Sometime she driveth o'er a soldier's neck,"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,1,4,MERCUTIO,31,"And then dreams he of cutting foreign throats,"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,1,4,MERCUTIO,32,"Of breaches, ambuscadoes, Spanish blades,"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,1,4,MERCUTIO,33,Of healths five-fathom deep; and then anon
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,1,4,MERCUTIO,34,"Drums in his ear, at which he starts and wakes,"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,1,4,MERCUTIO,35,And being thus frighted swears a prayer or two
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,1,4,MERCUTIO,36,And sleeps again. This is that very Mab
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,1,4,MERCUTIO,37,"That plats the manes of horses in the night,"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,1,4,MERCUTIO,38,"And bakes the elflocks in foul sluttish hairs,"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,1,4,MERCUTIO,39,"Which once untangled, much misfortune bodes:"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,1,4,MERCUTIO,40,"This is the hag, when maids lie on their backs,"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,1,4,MERCUTIO,41,"That presses them and learns them first to bear,"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,1,4,MERCUTIO,42,Making them women of good carriage:
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,1,4,MERCUTIO,43,This is she--
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,1,4,ROMEO,1,"Peace, peace, Mercutio, peace!"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,1,4,ROMEO,2,Thou talk'st of nothing.
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,1,4,MERCUTIO,1,"True, I talk of dreams,"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,1,4,MERCUTIO,2,"Which are the children of an idle brain,"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,1,4,MERCUTIO,3,"Begot of nothing but vain fantasy,"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,1,4,MERCUTIO,4,Which is as thin of substance as the air
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,1,4,MERCUTIO,5,"And more inconstant than the wind, who wooes"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,1,4,MERCUTIO,6,"Even now the frozen bosom of the north,"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,1,4,MERCUTIO,7,"And, being anger'd, puffs away from thence,"

The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,1,5,CAPULET,3,"And, to say truth, Verona brags of him"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,1,5,CAPULET,4,To be a virtuous and well-govern'd youth:
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,1,5,CAPULET,5,I would not for the wealth of all the town

The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,2,JULIET,9,Retain that dear perfection which he owes
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,2,JULIET,10,"Without that title. Romeo, doff thy name,"

The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,2,ROMEO,1,I take thee at thy word:
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,2,ROMEO,2,"Call me but love, and I'll be new baptized;"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,2,ROMEO,3,Henceforth I never will be Romeo.
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,2,JULIET,1,What man art thou that thus bescreen'd in night
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,2,JULIET,2,So stumblest on my counsel?
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,2,ROMEO,1,By a name
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,2,ROMEO,2,I know not how to tell thee who I am:
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,2,ROMEO,3,"My name, dear saint, is hateful to myself,"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,2,ROMEO,4,Because it is an enemy to thee;
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,2,ROMEO,5,"Had I it written, I would tear the word."
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,2,JULIET,1,My ears have not yet drunk a hundred words
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,2,JULIET,2,"Of that tongue's utterance, yet I know the sound:"

The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,2,JULIET,1,"How camest thou hither, tell me, and wherefore?"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,2,JULIET,2,"The orchard walls are high and hard to climb,"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,2,JULIET,3,"And the place death, considering who thou art,"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,2,JULIET,4,If any of my kinsmen find thee here.
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,2,ROMEO,1,With love's light wings did I o'er-perch these walls;
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,2,ROMEO,2,"For stony limits cannot hold love out,"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,2,ROMEO,3,And what love can do that dares love attempt;
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,2,ROMEO,4,Therefore thy kinsmen are no let to me.
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,2,JULIET,1,"If they do see thee, they will murder thee."
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,2,ROMEO,1,"Alack, there lies more peril in thine eye"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,2,ROMEO,2,"Than twenty of their swords: look thou but sweet,"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,2,ROMEO,3,And I am proof against their enmity.
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,2,JULIET,1,I would not for the world they saw thee here.
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,2,ROMEO,1,I have night's cloak to hide me from their sight;
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,2,ROMEO,2,"And but thou love me, let them find me here:"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,2,ROMEO,3,"My life were better ended by their hate,"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,2,ROMEO,4,"Than death prorogued, wanting of thy love."
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,2,JULIET,1,By whose direction found'st thou out this place?
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,2,ROMEO,1,"By love, who first did prompt me to inquire;"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,2,ROMEO,2,He lent me counsel and I lent him eyes.
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,2,ROMEO,3,"I am no pilot; yet, wert thou as far"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,2,ROMEO,4,"As that vast shore wash'd with the farthest sea,"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,2,ROMEO,5,I would adventure for such merchandise.
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,2,JULIET,1,"Thou know'st the mask of night is on my face,"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,2,JULIET,2,Else would a maiden blush bepaint my cheek
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,2,JULIET,3,For that which thou hast heard me speak to-night
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,2,JULIET,4,"Fain would I dwell on form, fain, fain deny"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,2,JULIET,5,What I have spoke: but farewell compliment!
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,2,JULIET,6,"Dost thou love me? I know thou wilt say 'Ay,'"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,2,JULIET,7,"And I will take thy word: yet if thou swear'st,"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,2,JULIET,8,Thou mayst prove false; at lovers' perjuries
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,2,JULIET,9,"Then say, Jove laughs. O gentle Romeo,"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,2,JULIET,10,"If thou dost love, pronounce it faithfully:"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,2,JULIET,11,"Or if thou think'st I am too quickly won,"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,2,JULIET,12,"I'll frown and be perverse an say thee nay,"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,2,JULIET,13,"So thou wilt woo; but else, not for the world."
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,2,JULIET,14,"In truth, fair Montague, I am too fond,"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,2,JULIET,15,And therefore thou mayst think my 'havior light:
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,2,JULIET,16,"But trust me, gentleman, I'll prove more true"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,2,JULIET,17,Than those that have more cunning to be strange.
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,2,JULIET,18,"I should have been more strange, I must confess,"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,2,JULIET,19,"But that thou overheard'st, ere I was ware,"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,2,JULIET,20,"My true love's passion: therefore pardon me,"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,2,JULIET,21,"And not impute this yielding to light love,"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,2,JULIET,22,Which the dark night hath so discovered.
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,2,ROMEO,1,"Lady, by yonder blessed moon I swear"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,2,ROMEO,2,That tips with silver all these fruit-tree tops--
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,2,JULIET,1,"O, swear not by the moon, the inconstant moon,"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,2,JULIET,2,"That monthly changes in her circled orb,"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,2,JULIET,3,Lest that thy love prove likewise variable.
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,2,ROMEO,1,What shall I swear by?
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,2,JULIET,1,Do not swear at all;
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,2,JULIET,2,"Or, if thou wilt, swear by thy gracious self,"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,2,JULIET,3,"Which is the god of my idolatry,"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,2,JULIET,4,And I'll believe thee.
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,2,ROMEO,1,If my heart's dear love--
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,2,JULIET,1,"Well, do not swear: although I joy in thee,"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,2,JULIET,2,I have no joy of this contract to-night:
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,2,JULIET,3,"It is too rash, too unadvised, too sudden;"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,2,JULIET,4,"Too like the lightning, which doth cease to be"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,2,JULIET,5,"Ere one can say 'It lightens.' Sweet, good night!"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,2,JULIET,6,"This bud of love, by summer's ripening breath,"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,2,JULIET,7,May prove a beauteous flower when next we meet.
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,2,JULIET,8,"Good night, good night! as sweet repose and rest"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,2,JULIET,9,Come to thy heart as that within my breast!
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,2,ROMEO,1,"O, wilt thou leave me so unsatisfied?"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,2,JULIET,1,What satisfaction canst thou have to-night?
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,2,ROMEO,1,The exchange of thy love's faithful vow for mine.
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,2,JULIET,1,I gave thee mine before thou didst request it:
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,2,JULIET,2,And yet I would it were to give again.
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,2,ROMEO,1,"Wouldst thou withdraw it? for what purpose, love?"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,2,JULIET,1,"But to be frank, and give it thee again."
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,2,JULIET,2,And yet I wish but for the thing I have:
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,2,JULIET,3,"My bounty is as boundless as the sea,"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,2,JULIET,4,"My love as deep; the more I give to thee,"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,2,JULIET,5,"The more I have, for both are infinite."
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,2,JULIET,6,"I hear some noise within; dear love, adieu!"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,2,JULIET,7,"Anon, good nurse! Sweet Montague, be true."
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,2,JULIET,8,"Stay but a little, I will come again."
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,2,ROMEO,1,"O blessed, blessed night! I am afeard."
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,2,ROMEO,2,"Being in night, all this is but a dream,"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,2,ROMEO,3,Too flattering-sweet to be substantial.
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,2,JULIET,1,"Three words, dear Romeo, and good night indeed."
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,2,JULIET,2,"If that thy bent of love be honourable,"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,2,JULIET,3,"Thy purpose marriage, send me word to-morrow,"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,2,JULIET,4,"By one that I'll procure to come to thee,"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,2,JULIET,5,Where and what time thou wilt perform the rite;
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,2,JULIET,6,And all my fortunes at thy foot I'll lay
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,2,JULIET,7,And follow thee my lord throughout the world.
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,2,JULIET,1,"I come, anon.--But if thou mean'st not well,"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,2,JULIET,2,I do beseech thee--
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,2,JULIET,1,"By and by, I come:--"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,2,JULIET,2,"To cease thy suit, and leave me to my grief:"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,2,JULIET,3,To-morrow will I send.
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,2,ROMEO,1,So thrive my soul--
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,2,JULIET,1,A thousand times good night!
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,2,ROMEO,1,"A thousand times the worse, to want thy light."
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,2,ROMEO,2,"Love goes toward love, as schoolboys from"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,2,ROMEO,3,"their books,"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,2,ROMEO,4,"But love from love, toward school with heavy looks."
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,2,JULIET,1,"Hist! Romeo, hist! O, for a falconer's voice,"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,2,JULIET,2,To lure this tassel-gentle back again!
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,2,JULIET,3,"Bondage is hoarse, and may not speak aloud;"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,2,JULIET,4,"Else would I tear the cave where Echo lies,"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,2,JULIET,5,"And make her airy tongue more hoarse than mine,"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,2,JULIET,6,With repetition of my Romeo's name.
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,2,ROMEO,1,It is my soul that calls upon my name:
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,2,ROMEO,2,"How silver-sweet sound lovers' tongues by night,"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,2,ROMEO,3,Like softest music to attending ears!
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,2,JULIET,1,Romeo!
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,2,ROMEO,1,My dear?
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,2,JULIET,1,At what o'clock to-morrow
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,2,JULIET,2,Shall I send to thee?
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,2,ROMEO,1,At the hour of nine.
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,2,JULIET,1,I will not fail: 'tis twenty years till then.
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,2,JULIET,2,I have forgot why I did call thee back.
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,2,ROMEO,1,Let me stand here till thou remember it.
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,2,JULIET,1,"I shall forget, to have thee still stand there,"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,2,JULIET,2,Remembering how I love thy company.
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,2,ROMEO,1,"And I'll still stay, to have thee still forget,"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,2,ROMEO,2,Forgetting any other home but this.
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,2,JULIET,1,'Tis almost morning; I would have thee gone:
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,2,JULIET,2,And yet no further than a wanton's bird;
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,2,JULIET,3,"Who lets it hop a little from her hand,"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,2,JULIET,4,"Like a poor prisoner in his twisted gyves,"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,2,JULIET,5,"And with a silk thread plucks it back again,"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,2,JULIET,6,So loving-jealous of his liberty.
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,2,ROMEO,1,I would I were thy bird.
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,2,JULIET,1,"Sweet, so would I:"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,2,JULIET,2,Yet I should kill thee with much cherishing.
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,2,JULIET,3,"Good night, good night! parting is such"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,2,JULIET,4,"sweet sorrow,"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,2,JULIET,5,That I shall say good night till it be morrow.
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,2,ROMEO,1,"Sleep dwell upon thine eyes, peace in thy breast!"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,2,ROMEO,2,"Would I were sleep and peace, so sweet to rest!"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,2,ROMEO,3,"Hence will I to my ghostly father's cell,"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,2,ROMEO,4,"His help to crave, and my dear hap to tell."
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,3,FRIAR LAURENCE,1,"The grey-eyed morn smiles on the frowning night,"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,3,FRIAR LAURENCE,2,"Chequering the eastern clouds with streaks of light,"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,3,FRIAR LAURENCE,3,And flecked darkness like a drunkard reels
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,3,FRIAR LAURENCE,4,From forth day's path and Titan's fiery wheels:
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,3,FRIAR LAURENCE,5,"Now, ere the sun advance his burning eye,"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,3,FRIAR LAURENCE,6,"The day to cheer and night's dank dew to dry,"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,3,FRIAR LAURENCE,7,I must up-fill this osier cage of ours
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,3,FRIAR LAURENCE,8,With baleful weeds and precious-juiced flowers.
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,3,FRIAR LAURENCE,9,The earth that's nature's mother is her tomb;
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,3,FRIAR LAURENCE,10,"What is her burying grave that is her womb,"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,3,FRIAR LAURENCE,11,And from her womb children of divers kind
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,3,FRIAR LAURENCE,12,"We sucking on her natural bosom find,"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,3,FRIAR LAURENCE,13,"Many for many virtues excellent,"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,3,FRIAR LAURENCE,14,None but for some and yet all different.
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,3,FRIAR LAURENCE,15,"O, mickle is the powerful grace that lies"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,3,FRIAR LAURENCE,16,"In herbs, plants, stones, and their true qualities:"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,3,FRIAR LAURENCE,17,For nought so vile that on the earth doth live
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,3,FRIAR LAURENCE,18,"But to the earth some special good doth give,"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,3,FRIAR LAURENCE,19,Nor aught so good but strain'd from that fair use
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,3,FRIAR LAURENCE,20,"Revolts from true birth, stumbling on abuse:"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,3,FRIAR LAURENCE,21,"Virtue itself turns vice, being misapplied;"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,3,FRIAR LAURENCE,22,And vice sometimes by action dignified.
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,3,FRIAR LAURENCE,23,Within the infant rind of this small flower
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,3,FRIAR LAURENCE,24,Poison hath residence and medicine power:
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,3,FRIAR LAURENCE,25,"For this, being smelt, with that part cheers each part;"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,3,FRIAR LAURENCE,26,"Being tasted, slays all senses with the heart."
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,3,FRIAR LAURENCE,27,Two such opposed kings encamp them still
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,3,FRIAR LAURENCE,28,"In man as well as herbs, grace and rude will;"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,3,FRIAR LAURENCE,29,"And where the worser is predominant,"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,3,FRIAR LAURENCE,30,Full soon the canker death eats up that plant.
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,3,ROMEO,1,"Good morrow, father."
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,3,FRIAR LAURENCE,1,Benedicite!
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,3,FRIAR LAURENCE,2,What early tongue so sweet saluteth me?
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,3,FRIAR LAURENCE,3,"Young son, it argues a distemper'd head"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,3,FRIAR LAURENCE,4,So soon to bid good morrow to thy bed:
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,3,FRIAR LAURENCE,5,"Care keeps his watch in every old man's eye,"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,3,FRIAR LAURENCE,6,"And where care lodges, sleep will never lie;"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,3,FRIAR LAURENCE,7,But where unbruised youth with unstuff'd brain
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,3,FRIAR LAURENCE,8,"Doth couch his limbs, there golden sleep doth reign:"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,3,FRIAR LAURENCE,9,Therefore thy earliness doth me assure
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,3,FRIAR LAURENCE,10,Thou art up-roused by some distemperature;
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,3,FRIAR LAURENCE,11,"Or if not so, then here I hit it right,"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,3,FRIAR LAURENCE,12,Our Romeo hath not been in bed to-night.
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,3,ROMEO,1,That last is true; the sweeter rest was mine.
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,3,FRIAR LAURENCE,1,God pardon sin! wast thou with Rosaline?
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,3,ROMEO,1,"With Rosaline, my ghostly father? no;"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,3,ROMEO,2,"I have forgot that name, and that name's woe."
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,3,FRIAR LAURENCE,1,"That's my good son: but where hast thou been, then?"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,3,ROMEO,1,"I'll tell thee, ere thou ask it me again."
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,3,ROMEO,2,"I have been feasting with mine enemy,"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,3,ROMEO,3,"Where on a sudden one hath wounded me,"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,3,ROMEO,4,That's by me wounded: both our remedies
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,3,ROMEO,5,Within thy help and holy physic lies:
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,3,ROMEO,6,"I bear no hatred, blessed man, for, lo,"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,3,ROMEO,7,My intercession likewise steads my foe.
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,3,FRIAR LAURENCE,1,"Be plain, good son, and homely in thy drift;"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,3,FRIAR LAURENCE,2,Riddling confession finds but riddling shrift.
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,3,ROMEO,1,Then plainly know my heart's dear love is set
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,3,ROMEO,2,On the fair daughter of rich Capulet:
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,3,ROMEO,3,"As mine on hers, so hers is set on mine;"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,3,ROMEO,4,"And all combined, save what thou must combine"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,3,ROMEO,5,By holy marriage: when and where and how
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,3,ROMEO,6,"We met, we woo'd and made exchange of vow,"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,3,ROMEO,7,"I'll tell thee as we pass; but this I pray,"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,3,ROMEO,8,That thou consent to marry us to-day.
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,3,FRIAR LAURENCE,1,"Holy Saint Francis, what a change is here!"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,3,FRIAR LAURENCE,2,"Is Rosaline, whom thou didst love so dear,"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,3,FRIAR LAURENCE,3,So soon forsaken? young men's love then lies
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,3,FRIAR LAURENCE,4,"Not truly in their hearts, but in their eyes."
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,3,FRIAR LAURENCE,5,"Jesu Maria, what a deal of brine"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,3,FRIAR LAURENCE,6,Hath wash'd thy sallow cheeks for Rosaline!
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,3,FRIAR LAURENCE,7,"How much salt water thrown away in waste,"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,3,FRIAR LAURENCE,8,"To season love, that of it doth not taste!"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,3,FRIAR LAURENCE,9,"The sun not yet thy sighs from heaven clears,"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,3,FRIAR LAURENCE,10,Thy old groans ring yet in my ancient ears;
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,3,FRIAR LAURENCE,11,"Lo, here upon thy cheek the stain doth sit"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,3,FRIAR LAURENCE,12,Of an old tear that is not wash'd off yet:
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,3,FRIAR LAURENCE,13,"If e'er thou wast thyself and these woes thine,"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,3,FRIAR LAURENCE,14,Thou and these woes were all for Rosaline:
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,3,FRIAR LAURENCE,15,"And art thou changed? pronounce this sentence then,"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,3,FRIAR LAURENCE,16,"Women may fall, when there's no strength in men."
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,3,ROMEO,1,Thou chid'st me oft for loving Rosaline.
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,3,FRIAR LAURENCE,1,"For doting, not for loving, pupil mine."
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,3,ROMEO,1,And bad'st me bury love.
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,3,FRIAR LAURENCE,1,"Not in a grave,"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,3,FRIAR LAURENCE,2,"To lay one in, another out to have."
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,3,ROMEO,1,"I pray thee, chide not; she whom I love now"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,3,ROMEO,2,Doth grace for grace and love for love allow;
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,3,ROMEO,3,The other did not so.
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,3,FRIAR LAURENCE,1,"O, she knew well"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,3,FRIAR LAURENCE,2,Thy love did read by rote and could not spell.
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,3,FRIAR LAURENCE,3,"But come, young waverer, come, go with me,"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,3,FRIAR LAURENCE,4,In one respect I'll thy assistant be;
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,3,FRIAR LAURENCE,5,"For this alliance may so happy prove,"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,3,FRIAR LAURENCE,6,To turn your households' rancour to pure love.
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,3,ROMEO,1,"O, let us hence; I stand on sudden haste."
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,3,FRIAR LAURENCE,1,Wisely and slow; they stumble that run fast.
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,4,MERCUTIO,1,Where the devil should this Romeo be?
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,4,MERCUTIO,2,Came he not home to-night?
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,4,BENVOLIO,1,Not to his father's; I spoke with his man.
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,4,MERCUTIO,1,"Ah, that same pale hard-hearted wench, that Rosaline."
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,4,MERCUTIO,2,"Torments him so, that he will sure run mad."
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,4,BENVOLIO,1,"Tybalt, the kinsman of old Capulet,"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,4,BENVOLIO,2,Hath sent a letter to his father's house.
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,4,MERCUTIO,1,"A challenge, on my life."
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,4,BENVOLIO,1,Romeo will answer it.
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,4,MERCUTIO,1,Any man that can write may answer a letter.
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,4,BENVOLIO,1,"Nay, he will answer the letter's master, how he"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,4,BENVOLIO,2,"dares, being dared."
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,4,MERCUTIO,1,Alas poor Romeo! he is already dead; stabbed with a
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,4,MERCUTIO,2,white wench's black eye; shot through the ear with a
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,4,MERCUTIO,3,love-song; the very pin of his heart cleft with the
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,4,MERCUTIO,4,blind bow-boy's butt-shaft: and is he a man to
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,4,MERCUTIO,5,encounter Tybalt?
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,4,BENVOLIO,1,"Why, what is Tybalt?"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,4,MERCUTIO,1,"More than prince of cats, I can tell you. O, he is"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,4,MERCUTIO,2,the courageous captain of compliments. He fights as
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,4,MERCUTIO,3,"you sing prick-song, keeps time, distance, and"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,4,MERCUTIO,4,"proportion; rests me his minim rest, one, two, and"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,4,MERCUTIO,5,the third in your bosom: the very butcher of a silk
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,4,MERCUTIO,6,"button, a duellist, a duellist; a gentleman of the"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,4,MERCUTIO,7,"very first house, of the first and second cause:"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,4,MERCUTIO,8,"ah, the immortal passado! the punto reverso! the"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,4,MERCUTIO,9,hai!
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,4,BENVOLIO,1,The what?
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,4,MERCUTIO,1,"The pox of such antic, lisping, affecting"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,4,MERCUTIO,2,"fantasticoes; these new tuners of accents! 'By Jesu,"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,4,MERCUTIO,3,a very good blade! a very tall man! a very good
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,4,MERCUTIO,4,"whore!' Why, is not this a lamentable thing,"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,4,MERCUTIO,5,"grandsire, that we should be thus afflicted with"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,4,MERCUTIO,6,"these strange flies, these fashion-mongers, these"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,4,MERCUTIO,7,"perdona-mi's, who stand so much on the new form,"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,4,MERCUTIO,8,"that they cannot at ease on the old bench? O, their"

The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,4,BENVOLIO,1,"Here comes Romeo, here comes Romeo."
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,4,MERCUTIO,1,"Without his roe, like a dried herring: flesh, flesh,"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,4,MERCUTIO,2,how art thou fishified! Now is he for the numbers
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,4,MERCUTIO,3,that Petrarch flowed in: Laura to his lady was but a
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,4,MERCUTIO,4,"kitchen-wench; marry, she had a better love to"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,4,MERCUTIO,5,be-rhyme her; Dido a dowdy; Cleopatra a gipsy;
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,4,MERCUTIO,6,Helen and Hero hildings and harlots; Thisbe a grey
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,4,MERCUTIO,7,"eye or so, but not to the purpose. Signior"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,4,MERCUTIO,8,"Romeo, bon jour! there's a French salutation"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,4,MERCUTIO,9,to your French slop. You gave us the counterfeit
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,4,MERCUTIO,10,fairly last night.
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,4,ROMEO,1,Good morrow to you both. What counterfeit did I give you?
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,4,MERCUTIO,1,"The ship, sir, the slip; can you not conceive?"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,4,ROMEO,1,"Pardon, good Mercutio, my business was great; and in"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,4,ROMEO,2,such a case as mine a man may strain courtesy.
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,4,MERCUTIO,1,"That's as much as to say, such a case as yours"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,4,MERCUTIO,2,constrains a man to bow in the hams.
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,4,ROMEO,1,"Meaning, to court'sy."
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,4,MERCUTIO,1,Thou hast most kindly hit it.
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,4,ROMEO,1,A most courteous exposition.
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,4,MERCUTIO,1,"Nay, I am the very pink of courtesy."
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,4,ROMEO,1,Pink for flower.
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,4,MERCUTIO,1,Right.
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,4,ROMEO,1,"Why, then is my pump well flowered."
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,4,MERCUTIO,1,Well said: follow me this jest now till thou hast
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,4,MERCUTIO,2,"worn out thy pump, that when the single sole of it"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,4,MERCUTIO,3,"is worn, the jest may remain after the wearing sole singular."
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,4,ROMEO,1,"O single-soled jest, solely singular for the"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,4,ROMEO,2,singleness.
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,4,MERCUTIO,1,"Come between us, good Benvolio; my wits faint."
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,4,ROMEO,1,"Switch and spurs, switch and spurs; or I'll cry a match."
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,4,MERCUTIO,1,"Nay, if thy wits run the wild-goose chase, I have"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,4,MERCUTIO,2,"done, for thou hast more of the wild-goose in one of"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,4,MERCUTIO,3,"thy wits than, I am sure, I have in my whole five:"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,4,MERCUTIO,4,was I with you there for the goose?
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,4,ROMEO,1,Thou wast never with me for any thing when thou wast
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,4,ROMEO,2,not there for the goose.
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,4,MERCUTIO,1,I will bite thee by the ear for that jest.
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,4,ROMEO,1,"Nay, good goose, bite not."
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,4,MERCUTIO,1,Thy wit is a very bitter sweeting; it is a most
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,4,MERCUTIO,2,sharp sauce.
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,4,ROMEO,1,And is it not well served in to a sweet goose?
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,4,MERCUTIO,1,"O here's a wit of cheveril, that stretches from an"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,4,MERCUTIO,2,inch narrow to an ell broad!
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,4,ROMEO,1,I stretch it out for that word 'broad;' which added
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,4,ROMEO,2,"to the goose, proves thee far and wide a broad goose."
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,4,MERCUTIO,1,"Why, is not this better now than groaning for love?"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,4,MERCUTIO,2,"now art thou sociable, now art thou Romeo; now art"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,4,MERCUTIO,3,"thou what thou art, by art as well as by nature:"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,4,MERCUTIO,4,"for this drivelling love is like a great natural,"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,4,MERCUTIO,5,that runs lolling up and down to hide his bauble in a hole.
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,4,BENVOLIO,1,"Stop there, stop there."
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,4,MERCUTIO,1,Thou desirest me to stop in my tale against the hair.
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,4,BENVOLIO,1,Thou wouldst else have made thy tale large.
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,4,MERCUTIO,1,"O, thou art deceived; I would have made it short:"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,4,MERCUTIO,2,for I was come to the whole depth of my tale; and
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,4,MERCUTIO,3,"meant, indeed, to occupy the argument no longer."
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,4,ROMEO,1,Here's goodly gear!
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,4,MERCUTIO,1,"A sail, a sail!"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,4,BENVOLIO,1,"Two, two; a shirt and a smock."
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,4,NURSE,1,Peter!
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,4,PETER,1,Anon!
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,4,NURSE,1,"My fan, Peter."
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,4,MERCUTIO,1,"Good Peter, to hide her face; for her fan's the"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,4,MERCUTIO,2,fairer face.
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,4,NURSE,1,"God ye good morrow, gentlemen."
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,4,MERCUTIO,1,"God ye good den, fair gentlewoman."
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,4,NURSE,1,Is it good den?
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,4,MERCUTIO,1,"'Tis no less, I tell you, for the bawdy hand of the"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,4,MERCUTIO,2,dial is now upon the prick of noon.
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,4,NURSE,1,Out upon you! what a man are you!
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,4,ROMEO,1,"One, gentlewoman, that God hath made for himself to"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,4,ROMEO,2,mar.
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,4,NURSE,1,"By my troth, it is well said; 'for himself to mar,'"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,4,NURSE,2,"quoth a'? Gentlemen, can any of you tell me where I"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,4,NURSE,3,may find the young Romeo?
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,4,ROMEO,1,I can tell you; but young Romeo will be older when
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,4,ROMEO,2,you have found him than he was when you sought him:
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,4,ROMEO,3,"I am the youngest of that name, for fault of a worse."
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,4,NURSE,1,You say well.
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,4,MERCUTIO,1,"Yea, is the worst well? very well took, i' faith;"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,4,MERCUTIO,2,"wisely, wisely."
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,4,NURSE,1,"if you be he, sir, I desire some confidence with"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,4,NURSE,2,you.
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,4,BENVOLIO,1,She will indite him to some supper.
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,4,MERCUTIO,1,"A bawd, a bawd, a bawd! so ho!"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,4,ROMEO,1,What hast thou found?
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,4,MERCUTIO,1,"No hare, sir; unless a hare, sir, in a lenten pie,"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,4,MERCUTIO,2,that is something stale and hoar ere it be spent.
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,4,MERCUTIO,3,"An old hare hoar,"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,4,MERCUTIO,4,"And an old hare hoar,"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,4,MERCUTIO,5,Is very good meat in lent
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,4,MERCUTIO,6,But a hare that is hoar
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,4,MERCUTIO,7,"Is too much for a score,"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,4,MERCUTIO,8,When it hoars ere it be spent.
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,4,MERCUTIO,9,"Romeo, will you come to your father's? we'll"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,4,MERCUTIO,10,"to dinner, thither."
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,4,ROMEO,1,I will follow you.
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,4,MERCUTIO,1,"Farewell, ancient lady; farewell,"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,4,MERCUTIO,2,"'lady, lady, lady.'"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,4,NURSE,1,"Marry, farewell! I pray you, sir, what saucy"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,4,NURSE,2,"merchant was this, that was so full of his ropery?"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,4,ROMEO,1,"A gentleman, nurse, that loves to hear himself talk,"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,4,ROMEO,2,and will speak more in a minute than he will stand
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,4,ROMEO,3,to in a month.
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,4,NURSE,1,"An a' speak any thing against me, I'll take him"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,4,NURSE,2,"down, an a' were lustier than he is, and twenty such"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,4,NURSE,3,"Jacks; and if I cannot, I'll find those that shall."
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,4,NURSE,4,Scurvy knave! I am none of his flirt-gills; I am
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,4,NURSE,5,none of his skains-mates. And thou must stand by
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,4,NURSE,6,"too, and suffer every knave to use me at his pleasure?"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,4,PETER,1,"I saw no man use you a pleasure; if I had, my weapon"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,4,PETER,2,"should quickly have been out, I warrant you: I dare"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,4,PETER,3,"draw as soon as another man, if I see occasion in a"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,4,PETER,4,"good quarrel, and the law on my side."
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,4,NURSE,1,"Now, afore God, I am so vexed, that every part about"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,4,NURSE,2,"me quivers. Scurvy knave! Pray you, sir, a word:"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,4,NURSE,3,"and as I told you, my young lady bade me inquire you"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,4,NURSE,4,"out; what she bade me say, I will keep to myself:"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,4,NURSE,5,"but first let me tell ye, if ye should lead her into"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,4,NURSE,6,"a fool's paradise, as they say, it were a very gross"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,4,NURSE,7,"kind of behavior, as they say: for the gentlewoman"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,4,NURSE,8,"is young; and, therefore, if you should deal double"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,4,NURSE,9,"with her, truly it were an ill thing to be offered"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,4,NURSE,10,"to any gentlewoman, and very weak dealing."
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,4,ROMEO,1,"Nurse, commend me to thy lady and mistress. I"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,4,ROMEO,2,protest unto thee--
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,4,NURSE,1,"Good heart, and, i' faith, I will tell her as much:"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,4,NURSE,2,"Lord, Lord, she will be a joyful woman."
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,4,ROMEO,1,"What wilt thou tell her, nurse? thou dost not mark me."
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,4,NURSE,1,"I will tell her, sir, that you do protest; which, as"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,4,NURSE,2,"I take it, is a gentlemanlike offer."
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,4,ROMEO,1,Bid her devise
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,4,ROMEO,2,Some means to come to shrift this afternoon;
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,4,ROMEO,3,And there she shall at Friar Laurence' cell
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,4,ROMEO,4,Be shrived and married. Here is for thy pains.
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,4,NURSE,1,No truly sir; not a penny.
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,4,ROMEO,1,Go to; I say you shall.
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,4,NURSE,1,"This afternoon, sir? well, she shall be there."
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,4,ROMEO,1,"And stay, good nurse, behind the abbey wall:"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,4,ROMEO,2,Within this hour my man shall be with thee
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,4,ROMEO,3,And bring thee cords made like a tackled stair;
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,4,ROMEO,4,Which to the high top-gallant of my joy
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,4,ROMEO,5,Must be my convoy in the secret night.
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,4,ROMEO,6,"Farewell; be trusty, and I'll quit thy pains:"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,4,ROMEO,7,Farewell; commend me to thy mistress.
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,4,NURSE,1,"Now God in heaven bless thee! Hark you, sir."
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,4,ROMEO,1,"What say'st thou, my dear nurse?"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,4,NURSE,1,"Is your man secret? Did you ne'er hear say,"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,4,NURSE,2,"Two may keep counsel, putting one away?"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,4,ROMEO,1,"I warrant thee, my man's as true as steel."
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,4,NURSE,1,"Well, sir; my mistress is the sweetest lady--Lord,"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,4,NURSE,2,"Lord! when 'twas a little prating thing:--O, there"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,4,NURSE,3,"is a nobleman in town, one Paris, that would fain"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,4,NURSE,4,"lay knife aboard; but she, good soul, had as lief"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,4,NURSE,5,"see a toad, a very toad, as see him. I anger her"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,4,NURSE,6,sometimes and tell her that Paris is the properer
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,4,NURSE,7,"man; but, I'll warrant you, when I say so, she looks"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,4,NURSE,8,as pale as any clout in the versal world. Doth not
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,4,NURSE,9,rosemary and Romeo begin both with a letter?
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,4,ROMEO,1,"Ay, nurse; what of that? both with an R."
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,4,NURSE,1,Ah. mocker! that's the dog's name; R is for
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,4,NURSE,2,the--No; I know it begins with some other
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,4,NURSE,3,letter:--and she hath the prettiest sententious of
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,4,NURSE,4,"it, of you and rosemary, that it would do you good"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,4,NURSE,5,to hear it.
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,4,ROMEO,1,Commend me to thy lady.
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,4,NURSE,1,"Ay, a thousand times."
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,4,NURSE,2,Peter!
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,4,PETER,1,Anon!
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,4,NURSE,1,"Peter, take my fan, and go before and apace."
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,5,JULIET,1,The clock struck nine when I did send the nurse;
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,5,JULIET,2,In half an hour she promised to return.
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,5,JULIET,3,Perchance she cannot meet him: that's not so.
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,5,JULIET,4,"O, she is lame! love's heralds should be thoughts,"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,5,JULIET,5,"Which ten times faster glide than the sun's beams,"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,5,JULIET,6,Driving back shadows over louring hills:
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,5,JULIET,7,"Therefore do nimble-pinion'd doves draw love,"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,5,JULIET,8,And therefore hath the wind-swift Cupid wings.
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,5,JULIET,9,Now is the sun upon the highmost hill
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,5,JULIET,10,"Of this day's journey, and from nine till twelve"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,5,JULIET,11,"Is three long hours, yet she is not come."
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,5,JULIET,12,"Had she affections and warm youthful blood,"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,5,JULIET,13,She would be as swift in motion as a ball;
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,5,JULIET,14,"My words would bandy her to my sweet love,"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,5,JULIET,15,And his to me:
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,5,JULIET,16,"But old folks, many feign as they were dead;"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,5,JULIET,17,"Unwieldy, slow, heavy and pale as lead."
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,5,JULIET,18,"O God, she comes!"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,5,JULIET,19,"O honey nurse, what news?"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,5,JULIET,20,Hast thou met with him? Send thy man away.
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,5,NURSE,1,"Peter, stay at the gate."
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,5,JULIET,1,"Now, good sweet nurse,--O Lord, why look'st thou sad?"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,5,JULIET,2,"Though news be sad, yet tell them merrily;"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,5,JULIET,3,"If good, thou shamest the music of sweet news"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,5,JULIET,4,By playing it to me with so sour a face.
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,5,NURSE,1,"I am a-weary, give me leave awhile:"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,5,NURSE,2,"Fie, how my bones ache! what a jaunt have I had!"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,5,JULIET,1,"I would thou hadst my bones, and I thy news:"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,5,JULIET,2,"Nay, come, I pray thee, speak; good, good nurse, speak."
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,5,NURSE,1,"Jesu, what haste? can you not stay awhile?"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,5,NURSE,2,Do you not see that I am out of breath?
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,5,JULIET,1,"How art thou out of breath, when thou hast breath"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,5,JULIET,2,To say to me that thou art out of breath?
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,5,JULIET,3,The excuse that thou dost make in this delay
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,5,JULIET,4,Is longer than the tale thou dost excuse.
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,5,JULIET,5,"Is thy news good, or bad? answer to that;"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,5,JULIET,6,"Say either, and I'll stay the circumstance:"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,5,JULIET,7,"Let me be satisfied, is't good or bad?"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,5,NURSE,1,"Well, you have made a simple choice; you know not"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,5,NURSE,2,"how to choose a man: Romeo! no, not he; though his"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,5,NURSE,3,"face be better than any man's, yet his leg excels"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,5,NURSE,4,"all men's; and for a hand, and a foot, and a body,"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,5,NURSE,5,"though they be not to be talked on, yet they are"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,5,NURSE,6,"past compare: he is not the flower of courtesy,"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,5,NURSE,7,"but, I'll warrant him, as gentle as a lamb. Go thy"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,5,NURSE,8,"ways, wench; serve God. What, have you dined at home?"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,5,JULIET,1,"No, no: but all this did I know before."
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,5,JULIET,2,What says he of our marriage? what of that?
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,5,NURSE,1,"Lord, how my head aches! what a head have I!"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,5,NURSE,2,It beats as it would fall in twenty pieces.
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,5,NURSE,3,"My back o' t' other side,--O, my back, my back!"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,5,NURSE,4,"Beshrew your heart for sending me about,"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,5,NURSE,5,To catch my death with jaunting up and down!
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,5,JULIET,1,"I' faith, I am sorry that thou art not well."
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,5,JULIET,2,"Sweet, sweet, sweet nurse, tell me, what says my love?"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,5,NURSE,1,"Your love says, like an honest gentleman, and a"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,5,NURSE,2,"courteous, and a kind, and a handsome, and, I"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,5,NURSE,3,"warrant, a virtuous,--Where is your mother?"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,5,JULIET,1,"Where is my mother! why, she is within;"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,5,JULIET,2,Where should she be? How oddly thou repliest!
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,5,JULIET,3,"'Your love says, like an honest gentleman,"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,5,JULIET,4,Where is your mother?'
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,5,NURSE,1,O God's lady dear!
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,5,NURSE,2,"Are you so hot? marry, come up, I trow;"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,5,NURSE,3,Is this the poultice for my aching bones?
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,5,NURSE,4,Henceforward do your messages yourself.
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,5,JULIET,1,"Here's such a coil! come, what says Romeo?"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,5,NURSE,1,Have you got leave to go to shrift to-day?
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,5,JULIET,1,I have.
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,5,NURSE,1,Then hie you hence to Friar Laurence' cell;
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,5,NURSE,2,There stays a husband to make you a wife:
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,5,NURSE,3,"Now comes the wanton blood up in your cheeks,"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,5,NURSE,4,They'll be in scarlet straight at any news.
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,5,NURSE,5,"Hie you to church; I must another way,"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,5,NURSE,6,"To fetch a ladder, by the which your love"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,5,NURSE,7,Must climb a bird's nest soon when it is dark:
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,5,NURSE,8,"I am the drudge and toil in your delight,"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,5,NURSE,9,But you shall bear the burden soon at night.
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,5,NURSE,10,Go; I'll to dinner: hie you to the cell.
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,5,JULIET,1,"Hie to high fortune! Honest nurse, farewell."
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,6,FRIAR LAURENCE,1,"So smile the heavens upon this holy act,"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,6,FRIAR LAURENCE,2,That after hours with sorrow chide us not!
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,6,ROMEO,1,"Amen, amen! but come what sorrow can,"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,6,ROMEO,2,It cannot countervail the exchange of joy
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,6,ROMEO,3,That one short minute gives me in her sight:
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,6,ROMEO,4,"Do thou but close our hands with holy words,"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,6,ROMEO,5,Then love-devouring death do what he dare;
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,6,ROMEO,6,It is enough I may but call her mine.
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,6,FRIAR LAURENCE,1,These violent delights have violent ends
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,6,FRIAR LAURENCE,2,"And in their triumph die, like fire and powder,"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,6,FRIAR LAURENCE,3,Which as they kiss consume: the sweetest honey
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,6,FRIAR LAURENCE,4,Is loathsome in his own deliciousness
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,6,FRIAR LAURENCE,5,And in the taste confounds the appetite:
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,6,FRIAR LAURENCE,6,Therefore love moderately; long love doth so;
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,6,FRIAR LAURENCE,7,Too swift arrives as tardy as too slow.
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,6,FRIAR LAURENCE,8,"Here comes the lady: O, so light a foot"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,6,FRIAR LAURENCE,9,Will ne'er wear out the everlasting flint:
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,6,FRIAR LAURENCE,10,A lover may bestride the gossamer
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,6,FRIAR LAURENCE,11,"That idles in the wanton summer air,"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,6,FRIAR LAURENCE,12,And yet not fall; so light is vanity.
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,6,JULIET,1,Good even to my ghostly confessor.
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,6,FRIAR LAURENCE,1,"Romeo shall thank thee, daughter, for us both."
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,6,JULIET,1,"As much to him, else is his thanks too much."
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,6,ROMEO,1,"Ah, Juliet, if the measure of thy joy"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,6,ROMEO,2,Be heap'd like mine and that thy skill be more
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,6,ROMEO,3,"To blazon it, then sweeten with thy breath"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,6,ROMEO,4,"This neighbour air, and let rich music's tongue"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,6,ROMEO,5,Unfold the imagined happiness that both
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,6,ROMEO,6,Receive in either by this dear encounter.
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,6,JULIET,1,"Conceit, more rich in matter than in words,"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,6,JULIET,2,"Brags of his substance, not of ornament:"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,6,JULIET,3,They are but beggars that can count their worth;
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,6,JULIET,4,But my true love is grown to such excess
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,6,JULIET,5,I cannot sum up sum of half my wealth.
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,6,FRIAR LAURENCE,1,"Come, come with me, and we will make short work;"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,6,FRIAR LAURENCE,2,"For, by your leaves, you shall not stay alone"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,2,6,FRIAR LAURENCE,3,Till holy church incorporate two in one.
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,1,BENVOLIO,1,"I pray thee, good Mercutio, let's retire:"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,1,BENVOLIO,2,"The day is hot, the Capulets abroad,"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,1,BENVOLIO,3,"And, if we meet, we shall not scape a brawl;"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,1,BENVOLIO,4,"For now, these hot days, is the mad blood stirring."
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,1,MERCUTIO,1,Thou art like one of those fellows that when he
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,1,MERCUTIO,2,enters the confines of a tavern claps me his sword
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,1,MERCUTIO,3,upon the table and says 'God send me no need of
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,1,MERCUTIO,4,thee!' and by the operation of the second cup draws
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,1,MERCUTIO,5,"it on the drawer, when indeed there is no need."
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,1,BENVOLIO,1,Am I like such a fellow?
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,1,MERCUTIO,1,"Come, come, thou art as hot a Jack in thy mood as"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,1,MERCUTIO,2,"any in Italy, and as soon moved to be moody, and as"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,1,MERCUTIO,3,soon moody to be moved.
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,1,BENVOLIO,1,And what to?
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,1,MERCUTIO,1,"Nay, an there were two such, we should have none"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,1,MERCUTIO,2,"shortly, for one would kill the other. Thou! why,"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,1,MERCUTIO,3,"thou wilt quarrel with a man that hath a hair more,"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,1,MERCUTIO,4,"or a hair less, in his beard, than thou hast: thou"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,1,MERCUTIO,5,"wilt quarrel with a man for cracking nuts, having no"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,1,MERCUTIO,6,other reason but because thou hast hazel eyes: what
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,1,MERCUTIO,7,eye but such an eye would spy out such a quarrel?
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,1,MERCUTIO,8,Thy head is as fun of quarrels as an egg is full of
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,1,MERCUTIO,9,"meat, and yet thy head hath been beaten as addle as"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,1,MERCUTIO,10,an egg for quarrelling: thou hast quarrelled with a
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,1,MERCUTIO,11,"man for coughing in the street, because he hath"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,1,MERCUTIO,12,wakened thy dog that hath lain asleep in the sun:
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,1,MERCUTIO,13,didst thou not fall out with a tailor for wearing
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,1,MERCUTIO,14,"his new doublet before Easter? with another, for"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,1,MERCUTIO,15,tying his new shoes with old riband? and yet thou
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,1,MERCUTIO,16,wilt tutor me from quarrelling!
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,1,BENVOLIO,1,"An I were so apt to quarrel as thou art, any man"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,1,BENVOLIO,2,should buy the fee-simple of my life for an hour and a quarter.
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,1,MERCUTIO,1,The fee-simple! O simple!
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,1,BENVOLIO,1,"By my head, here come the Capulets."
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,1,MERCUTIO,1,"By my heel, I care not."
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,1,TYBALT,1,"Follow me close, for I will speak to them."
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,1,TYBALT,2,"Gentlemen, good den: a word with one of you."
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,1,MERCUTIO,1,And but one word with one of us? couple it with
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,1,MERCUTIO,2,something; make it a word and a blow.
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,1,TYBALT,1,"You shall find me apt enough to that, sir, an you"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,1,TYBALT,2,will give me occasion.
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,1,MERCUTIO,1,Could you not take some occasion without giving?
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,1,TYBALT,1,"Mercutio, thou consort'st with Romeo,--"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,1,MERCUTIO,1,"Consort! what, dost thou make us minstrels? an"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,1,MERCUTIO,2,"thou make minstrels of us, look to hear nothing but"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,1,MERCUTIO,3,discords: here's my fiddlestick; here's that shall
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,1,MERCUTIO,4,"make you dance. 'Zounds, consort!"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,1,BENVOLIO,1,We talk here in the public haunt of men:
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,1,BENVOLIO,2,"Either withdraw unto some private place,"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,1,BENVOLIO,3,"And reason coldly of your grievances,"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,1,BENVOLIO,4,Or else depart; here all eyes gaze on us.
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,1,MERCUTIO,1,"Men's eyes were made to look, and let them gaze;"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,1,MERCUTIO,2,"I will not budge for no man's pleasure, I."
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,1,TYBALT,1,"Well, peace be with you, sir: here comes my man."
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,1,MERCUTIO,1,"But I'll be hanged, sir, if he wear your livery:"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,1,MERCUTIO,2,"Marry, go before to field, he'll be your follower;"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,1,MERCUTIO,3,Your worship in that sense may call him 'man.'
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,1,TYBALT,1,"Romeo, the hate I bear thee can afford"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,1,TYBALT,2,"No better term than this,--thou art a villain."
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,1,ROMEO,1,"Tybalt, the reason that I have to love thee"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,1,ROMEO,2,Doth much excuse the appertaining rage
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,1,ROMEO,3,To such a greeting: villain am I none;
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,1,ROMEO,4,Therefore farewell; I see thou know'st me not.
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,1,TYBALT,1,"Boy, this shall not excuse the injuries"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,1,TYBALT,2,That thou hast done me; therefore turn and draw.
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,1,ROMEO,1,"I do protest, I never injured thee,"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,1,ROMEO,2,"But love thee better than thou canst devise,"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,1,ROMEO,3,Till thou shalt know the reason of my love:
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,1,ROMEO,4,"And so, good Capulet,--which name I tender"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,1,ROMEO,5,"As dearly as my own,--be satisfied."
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,1,MERCUTIO,1,"O calm, dishonourable, vile submission!"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,1,MERCUTIO,2,Alla stoccata carries it away.
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,1,MERCUTIO,3,"Tybalt, you rat-catcher, will you walk?"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,1,TYBALT,1,What wouldst thou have with me?
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,1,MERCUTIO,1,"Good king of cats, nothing but one of your nine"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,1,MERCUTIO,2,"lives; that I mean to make bold withal, and as you"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,1,MERCUTIO,3,"shall use me hereafter, drybeat the rest of the"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,1,MERCUTIO,4,eight. Will you pluck your sword out of his pitcher
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,1,MERCUTIO,5,"by the ears? make haste, lest mine be about your"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,1,MERCUTIO,6,ears ere it be out.
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,1,TYBALT,1,I am for you.
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,1,ROMEO,1,"Gentle Mercutio, put thy rapier up."
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,1,MERCUTIO,1,"Come, sir, your passado."
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,1,ROMEO,1,"Draw, Benvolio; beat down their weapons."
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,1,ROMEO,2,"Gentlemen, for shame, forbear this outrage!"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,1,ROMEO,3,"Tybalt, Mercutio, the prince expressly hath"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,1,ROMEO,4,Forbidden bandying in Verona streets:
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,1,ROMEO,5,"Hold, Tybalt! good Mercutio!"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,1,MERCUTIO,1,I am hurt.
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,1,MERCUTIO,2,A plague o' both your houses! I am sped.
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,1,MERCUTIO,3,"Is he gone, and hath nothing?"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,1,BENVOLIO,1,"What, art thou hurt?"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,1,MERCUTIO,1,"Ay, ay, a scratch, a scratch; marry, 'tis enough."
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,1,MERCUTIO,2,"Where is my page? Go, villain, fetch a surgeon."
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,1,ROMEO,1,"Courage, man; the hurt cannot be much."
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,1,MERCUTIO,1,"No, 'tis not so deep as a well, nor so wide as a"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,1,MERCUTIO,2,"church-door; but 'tis enough,'twill serve: ask for"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,1,MERCUTIO,3,"me to-morrow, and you shall find me a grave man. I"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,1,MERCUTIO,4,"am peppered, I warrant, for this world. A plague o'"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,1,MERCUTIO,5,"both your houses! 'Zounds, a dog, a rat, a mouse, a"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,1,MERCUTIO,6,"cat, to scratch a man to death! a braggart, a"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,1,MERCUTIO,7,"rogue, a villain, that fights by the book of"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,1,MERCUTIO,8,arithmetic! Why the devil came you between us? I
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,1,MERCUTIO,9,was hurt under your arm.
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,1,ROMEO,1,I thought all for the best.
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,1,MERCUTIO,1,"Help me into some house, Benvolio,"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,1,MERCUTIO,2,Or I shall faint. A plague o' both your houses!
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,1,MERCUTIO,3,"They have made worms' meat of me: I have it,"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,1,MERCUTIO,4,And soundly too: your houses!
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,1,ROMEO,1,"This gentleman, the prince's near ally,"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,1,ROMEO,2,"My very friend, hath got his mortal hurt"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,1,ROMEO,3,In my behalf; my reputation stain'd
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,1,ROMEO,4,"With Tybalt's slander,--Tybalt, that an hour"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,1,ROMEO,5,"Hath been my kinsman! O sweet Juliet,"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,1,ROMEO,6,Thy beauty hath made me effeminate
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,1,ROMEO,7,And in my temper soften'd valour's steel!
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,1,BENVOLIO,1,"O Romeo, Romeo, brave Mercutio's dead!"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,1,BENVOLIO,2,"That gallant spirit hath aspired the clouds,"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,1,BENVOLIO,3,Which too untimely here did scorn the earth.
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,1,ROMEO,1,This day's black fate on more days doth depend;
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,1,ROMEO,2,"This but begins the woe, others must end."
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,1,BENVOLIO,1,Here comes the furious Tybalt back again.
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,1,ROMEO,1,"Alive, in triumph! and Mercutio slain!"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,1,ROMEO,2,"Away to heaven, respective lenity,"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,1,ROMEO,3,And fire-eyed fury be my conduct now!
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,1,ROMEO,4,"Now, Tybalt, take the villain back again,"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,1,ROMEO,5,That late thou gavest me; for Mercutio's soul
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,1,ROMEO,6,"Is but a little way above our heads,"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,1,ROMEO,7,Staying for thine to keep him company:
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,1,ROMEO,8,"Either thou, or I, or both, must go with him."
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,1,TYBALT,1,"Thou, wretched boy, that didst consort him here,"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,1,TYBALT,2,Shalt with him hence.
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,1,ROMEO,1,This shall determine that.
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,1,BENVOLIO,1,"Romeo, away, be gone!"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,1,BENVOLIO,2,"The citizens are up, and Tybalt slain."
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,1,BENVOLIO,3,"Stand not amazed: the prince will doom thee death,"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,1,BENVOLIO,4,"If thou art taken: hence, be gone, away!"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,1,ROMEO,1,"O, I am fortune's fool!"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,1,BENVOLIO,1,Why dost thou stay?
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,1,FIRST CITIZEN,1,Which way ran he that kill'd Mercutio?
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,1,FIRST CITIZEN,2,"Tybalt, that murderer, which way ran he?"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,1,BENVOLIO,1,There lies that Tybalt.
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,1,FIRST CITIZEN,1,"Up, sir, go with me;"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,1,FIRST CITIZEN,2,"I charge thee in the princes name, obey."
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,1,PRINCE,1,Where are the vile beginners of this fray?
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,1,BENVOLIO,1,"O noble prince, I can discover all"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,1,BENVOLIO,2,The unlucky manage of this fatal brawl:
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,1,BENVOLIO,3,"There lies the man, slain by young Romeo,"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,1,BENVOLIO,4,"That slew thy kinsman, brave Mercutio."
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,1,LADY CAPULET,1,"Tybalt, my cousin! O my brother's child!"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,1,LADY CAPULET,2,"O prince! O cousin! husband! O, the blood is spilt"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,1,LADY CAPULET,3,"O my dear kinsman! Prince, as thou art true,"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,1,LADY CAPULET,4,"For blood of ours, shed blood of Montague."
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,1,LADY CAPULET,5,"O cousin, cousin!"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,1,PRINCE,1,"Benvolio, who began this bloody fray?"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,1,BENVOLIO,1,"Tybalt, here slain, whom Romeo's hand did slay;"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,1,BENVOLIO,2,"Romeo that spoke him fair, bade him bethink"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,1,BENVOLIO,3,"How nice the quarrel was, and urged withal"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,1,BENVOLIO,4,Your high displeasure: all this uttered
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,1,BENVOLIO,5,"With gentle breath, calm look, knees humbly bow'd,"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,1,BENVOLIO,6,Could not take truce with the unruly spleen
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,1,BENVOLIO,7,"Of Tybalt deaf to peace, but that he tilts"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,1,BENVOLIO,8,"With piercing steel at bold Mercutio's breast,"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,1,BENVOLIO,9,"Who all as hot, turns deadly point to point,"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,1,BENVOLIO,10,"And, with a martial scorn, with one hand beats"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,1,BENVOLIO,11,"Cold death aside, and with the other sends"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,1,BENVOLIO,12,"It back to Tybalt, whose dexterity,"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,1,BENVOLIO,13,"Retorts it: Romeo he cries aloud,"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,1,BENVOLIO,14,"'Hold, friends! friends, part!' and, swifter than"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,1,BENVOLIO,15,"his tongue,"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,1,BENVOLIO,16,"His agile arm beats down their fatal points,"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,1,BENVOLIO,17,And 'twixt them rushes; underneath whose arm
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,1,BENVOLIO,18,An envious thrust from Tybalt hit the life
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,1,BENVOLIO,19,"Of stout Mercutio, and then Tybalt fled;"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,1,BENVOLIO,20,"But by and by comes back to Romeo,"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,1,BENVOLIO,21,"Who had but newly entertain'd revenge,"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,1,BENVOLIO,22,"And to 't they go like lightning, for, ere I"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,1,BENVOLIO,23,"Could draw to part them, was stout Tybalt slain."
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,1,BENVOLIO,24,"And, as he fell, did Romeo turn and fly."
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,1,BENVOLIO,25,"This is the truth, or let Benvolio die."
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,1,LADY CAPULET,1,He is a kinsman to the Montague;
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,1,LADY CAPULET,2,Affection makes him false; he speaks not true:
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,1,LADY CAPULET,3,"Some twenty of them fought in this black strife,"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,1,LADY CAPULET,4,And all those twenty could but kill one life.
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,1,LADY CAPULET,5,"I beg for justice, which thou, prince, must give;"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,1,LADY CAPULET,6,"Romeo slew Tybalt, Romeo must not live."
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,1,PRINCE,1,"Romeo slew him, he slew Mercutio;"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,1,PRINCE,2,Who now the price of his dear blood doth owe?
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,1,MONTAGUE,1,"Not Romeo, prince, he was Mercutio's friend;"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,1,MONTAGUE,2,"His fault concludes but what the law should end,"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,1,MONTAGUE,3,The life of Tybalt.
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,1,PRINCE,1,And for that offence
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,1,PRINCE,2,Immediately we do exile him hence:
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,1,PRINCE,3,"I have an interest in your hate's proceeding,"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,1,PRINCE,4,My blood for your rude brawls doth lie a-bleeding;
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,1,PRINCE,5,But I'll amerce you with so strong a fine
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,1,PRINCE,6,That you shall all repent the loss of mine:
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,1,PRINCE,7,I will be deaf to pleading and excuses;
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,1,PRINCE,8,Nor tears nor prayers shall purchase out abuses:
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,1,PRINCE,9,"Therefore use none: let Romeo hence in haste,"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,1,PRINCE,10,"Else, when he's found, that hour is his last."
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,1,PRINCE,11,Bear hence this body and attend our will:
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,1,PRINCE,12,"Mercy but murders, pardoning those that kill."
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,2,JULIET,1,"Gallop apace, you fiery-footed steeds,"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,2,JULIET,2,Towards Phoebus' lodging: such a wagoner
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,2,JULIET,3,"As Phaethon would whip you to the west,"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,2,JULIET,4,And bring in cloudy night immediately.
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,2,JULIET,5,"Spread thy close curtain, love-performing night,"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,2,JULIET,6,That runaway's eyes may wink and Romeo
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,2,JULIET,7,"Leap to these arms, untalk'd of and unseen."
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,2,JULIET,8,Lovers can see to do their amorous rites
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,2,JULIET,9,"By their own beauties; or, if love be blind,"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,2,JULIET,10,"It best agrees with night. Come, civil night,"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,2,JULIET,11,"Thou sober-suited matron, all in black,"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,2,JULIET,12,"And learn me how to lose a winning match,"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,2,JULIET,13,Play'd for a pair of stainless maidenhoods:
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,2,JULIET,14,"Hood my unmann'd blood, bating in my cheeks,"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,2,JULIET,15,"With thy black mantle; till strange love, grown bold,"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,2,JULIET,16,Think true love acted simple modesty.
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,2,JULIET,17,"Come, night; come, Romeo; come, thou day in night;"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,2,JULIET,18,For thou wilt lie upon the wings of night
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,2,JULIET,19,Whiter than new snow on a raven's back.
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,2,JULIET,20,"Come, gentle night, come, loving, black-brow'd night,"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,2,JULIET,21,"Give me my Romeo; and, when he shall die,"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,2,JULIET,22,"Take him and cut him out in little stars,"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,2,JULIET,23,And he will make the face of heaven so fine
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,2,JULIET,24,That all the world will be in love with night
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,2,JULIET,25,And pay no worship to the garish sun.
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,2,JULIET,26,"O, I have bought the mansion of a love,"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,2,JULIET,27,"But not possess'd it, and, though I am sold,"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,2,JULIET,28,Not yet enjoy'd: so tedious is this day
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,2,JULIET,29,As is the night before some festival
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,2,JULIET,30,To an impatient child that hath new robes
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,2,JULIET,31,"And may not wear them. O, here comes my nurse,"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,2,JULIET,32,And she brings news; and every tongue that speaks
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,2,JULIET,33,But Romeo's name speaks heavenly eloquence.
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,2,JULIET,34,"Now, nurse, what news? What hast thou there? the cords"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,2,JULIET,35,That Romeo bid thee fetch?
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,2,NURSE,1,"Ay, ay, the cords."
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,2,JULIET,1,Ay me! what news? why dost thou wring thy hands?
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,2,NURSE,1,"Ah, well-a-day! he's dead, he's dead, he's dead!"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,2,NURSE,2,"We are undone, lady, we are undone!"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,2,NURSE,3,"Alack the day! he's gone, he's kill'd, he's dead!"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,2,JULIET,1,Can heaven be so envious?
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,2,NURSE,1,"Romeo can,"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,2,NURSE,2,"Though heaven cannot: O Romeo, Romeo!"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,2,NURSE,3,Who ever would have thought it? Romeo!
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,2,JULIET,1,"What devil art thou, that dost torment me thus?"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,2,JULIET,2,This torture should be roar'd in dismal hell.
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,2,JULIET,3,"Hath Romeo slain himself? say thou but 'I,'"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,2,JULIET,4,And that bare vowel 'I' shall poison more
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,2,JULIET,5,Than the death-darting eye of cockatrice:
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,2,JULIET,6,"I am not I, if there be such an I;"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,2,JULIET,7,"Or those eyes shut, that make thee answer 'I.'"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,2,JULIET,8,"If he be slain, say 'I'; or if not, no:"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,2,JULIET,9,Brief sounds determine of my weal or woe.
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,2,NURSE,1,"I saw the wound, I saw it with mine eyes,--"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,2,NURSE,2,God save the mark!--here on his manly breast:
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,2,NURSE,3,"A piteous corse, a bloody piteous corse;"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,2,NURSE,4,"Pale, pale as ashes, all bedaub'd in blood,"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,2,NURSE,5,All in gore-blood; I swounded at the sight.
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,2,JULIET,1,"O, break, my heart! poor bankrupt, break at once!"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,2,JULIET,2,"To prison, eyes, ne'er look on liberty!"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,2,JULIET,3,"Vile earth, to earth resign; end motion here;"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,2,JULIET,4,And thou and Romeo press one heavy bier!
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,2,NURSE,1,"O Tybalt, Tybalt, the best friend I had!"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,2,NURSE,2,O courteous Tybalt! honest gentleman!
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,2,NURSE,3,That ever I should live to see thee dead!
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,2,JULIET,1,What storm is this that blows so contrary?
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,2,JULIET,2,"Is Romeo slaughter'd, and is Tybalt dead?"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,2,JULIET,3,"My dear-loved cousin, and my dearer lord?"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,2,JULIET,4,"Then, dreadful trumpet, sound the general doom!"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,2,JULIET,5,"For who is living, if those two are gone?"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,2,NURSE,1,"Tybalt is gone, and Romeo banished;"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,2,NURSE,2,"Romeo that kill'd him, he is banished."
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,2,JULIET,1,O God! did Romeo's hand shed Tybalt's blood?
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,2,NURSE,1,"It did, it did; alas the day, it did!"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,2,JULIET,1,"O serpent heart, hid with a flowering face!"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,2,JULIET,2,Did ever dragon keep so fair a cave?

The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,2,JULIET,8,"O nature, what hadst thou to do in hell,"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,2,JULIET,9,When thou didst bower the spirit of a fiend
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,2,JULIET,10,In moral paradise of such sweet flesh?
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,2,JULIET,11,Was ever book containing such vile matter
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,2,JULIET,12,So fairly bound? O that deceit should dwell
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,2,JULIET,13,In such a gorgeous palace!
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,2,NURSE,1,"There's no trust,"

The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,2,NURSE,6,Shame come to Romeo!
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,2,JULIET,1,Blister'd be thy tongue
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,2,JULIET,2,For such a wish! he was not born to shame:
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,2,JULIET,3,Upon his brow shame is ashamed to sit;
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,2,JULIET,4,For 'tis a throne where honour may be crown'd
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,2,JULIET,5,Sole monarch of the universal earth.
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,2,JULIET,6,"O, what a beast was I to chide at him!"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,2,NURSE,1,Will you speak well of him that kill'd your cousin?
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,2,JULIET,1,Shall I speak ill of him that is my husband?
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,2,JULIET,2,"Ah, poor my lord, what tongue shall smooth thy name,"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,2,JULIET,3,"When I, thy three-hours wife, have mangled it?"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,2,JULIET,4,"But, wherefore, villain, didst thou kill my cousin?"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,2,JULIET,5,That villain cousin would have kill'd my husband:

The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,2,JULIET,21,"And needly will be rank'd with other griefs,"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,2,JULIET,22,"Why follow'd not, when she said 'Tybalt's dead,'"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,2,JULIET,23,"Thy father, or thy mother, nay, or both,"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,2,JULIET,24,Which modern lamentations might have moved?

The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,2,JULIET,29,"There is no end, no limit, measure, bound,"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,2,JULIET,30,In that word's death; no words can that woe sound.
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,2,JULIET,31,"Where is my father, and my mother, nurse?"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,2,NURSE,1,Weeping and wailing over Tybalt's corse:

The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,2,JULIET,3,"Take up those cords: poor ropes, you are beguiled,"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,2,JULIET,4,Both you and I; for Romeo is exiled:
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,2,JULIET,5,He made you for a highway to my bed;
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,2,JULIET,6,"But I, a maid, die maiden-widowed."
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,2,JULIET,7,"Come, cords, come, nurse; I'll to my wedding-bed;"

The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,2,NURSE,1,Hie to your chamber: I'll find Romeo
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,2,NURSE,2,To comfort you: I wot well where he is.
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,2,NURSE,3,"Hark ye, your Romeo will be here at night:"

The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,2,JULIET,1,"O, find him! give this ring to my true knight,"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,2,JULIET,2,And bid him come to take his last farewell.
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,3,FRIAR LAURENCE,1,"Romeo, come forth; come forth, thou fearful man:"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,3,FRIAR LAURENCE,2,"Affliction is enamour'd of thy parts,"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,3,FRIAR LAURENCE,3,And thou art wedded to calamity.
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,3,ROMEO,1,"Father, what news? what is the prince's doom?"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,3,ROMEO,2,"What sorrow craves acquaintance at my hand,"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,3,ROMEO,3,That I yet know not?
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,3,FRIAR LAURENCE,1,Too familiar
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,3,FRIAR LAURENCE,2,Is my dear son with such sour company:
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,3,FRIAR LAURENCE,3,I bring thee tidings of the prince's doom.
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,3,ROMEO,1,What less than dooms-day is the prince's doom?
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,3,FRIAR LAURENCE,1,"A gentler judgment vanish'd from his lips,"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,3,FRIAR LAURENCE,2,"Not body's death, but body's banishment."
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,3,ROMEO,1,"Ha, banishment! be merciful, say 'death;'"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,3,ROMEO,2,"For exile hath more terror in his look,"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,3,ROMEO,3,Much more than death: do not say 'banishment.'
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,3,FRIAR LAURENCE,1,Hence from Verona art thou banished:
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,3,FRIAR LAURENCE,2,"Be patient, for the world is broad and wide."
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,3,ROMEO,1,"There is no world without Verona walls,"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,3,ROMEO,2,"But purgatory, torture, hell itself."
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,3,ROMEO,3,"Hence-banished is banish'd from the world,"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,3,ROMEO,4,"And world's exile is death: then banished,"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,3,ROMEO,5,"Is death mis-term'd: calling death banishment,"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,3,ROMEO,6,"Thou cutt'st my head off with a golden axe,"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,3,ROMEO,7,And smilest upon the stroke that murders me.
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,3,FRIAR LAURENCE,1,O deadly sin! O rude unthankfulness!
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,3,FRIAR LAURENCE,2,"Thy fault our law calls death; but the kind prince,"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,3,FRIAR LAURENCE,3,"Taking thy part, hath rush'd aside the law,"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,3,FRIAR LAURENCE,4,And turn'd that black word death to banishment:
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,3,FRIAR LAURENCE,5,"This is dear mercy, and thou seest it not."
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,3,ROMEO,1,"'Tis torture, and not mercy: heaven is here,"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,3,ROMEO,2,Where Juliet lives; and every cat and dog
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,3,ROMEO,3,"And little mouse, every unworthy thing,"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,3,ROMEO,4,Live here in heaven and may look on her;
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,3,ROMEO,5,"But Romeo may not: more validity,"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,3,ROMEO,6,"More honourable state, more courtship lives"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,3,ROMEO,7,In carrion-flies than Romeo: they my seize
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,3,ROMEO,8,On the white wonder of dear Juliet's hand
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,3,ROMEO,9,"And steal immortal blessing from her lips,"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,3,ROMEO,10,"Who even in pure and vestal modesty,"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,3,ROMEO,11,"Still blush, as thinking their own kisses sin;"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,3,ROMEO,12,But Romeo may not; he is banished:
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,3,ROMEO,13,"Flies may do this, but I from this must fly:"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,3,ROMEO,14,"They are free men, but I am banished."
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,3,ROMEO,15,And say'st thou yet that exile is not death?
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,3,ROMEO,16,"Hadst thou no poison mix'd, no sharp-ground knife,"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,3,ROMEO,17,"No sudden mean of death, though ne'er so mean,"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,3,ROMEO,18,But 'banished' to kill me?--'banished'?
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,3,ROMEO,19,"O friar, the damned use that word in hell;"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,3,ROMEO,20,"Howlings attend it: how hast thou the heart,"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,3,ROMEO,21,"Being a divine, a ghostly confessor,"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,3,ROMEO,22,"A sin-absolver, and my friend profess'd,"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,3,ROMEO,23,To mangle me with that word 'banished'?
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,3,FRIAR LAURENCE,1,"Thou fond mad man, hear me but speak a word."
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,3,ROMEO,1,"O, thou wilt speak again of banishment."
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,3,FRIAR LAURENCE,1,I'll give thee armour to keep off that word:
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,3,FRIAR LAURENCE,2,"Adversity's sweet milk, philosophy,"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,3,FRIAR LAURENCE,3,"To comfort thee, though thou art banished."
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,3,ROMEO,1,Yet 'banished'? Hang up philosophy!
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,3,ROMEO,2,"Unless philosophy can make a Juliet,"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,3,ROMEO,3,"Displant a town, reverse a prince's doom,"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,3,ROMEO,4,"It helps not, it prevails not: talk no more."
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,3,FRIAR LAURENCE,1,"O, then I see that madmen have no ears."
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,3,ROMEO,1,"How should they, when that wise men have no eyes?"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,3,FRIAR LAURENCE,1,Let me dispute with thee of thy estate.
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,3,ROMEO,1,Thou canst not speak of that thou dost not feel:
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,3,ROMEO,2,"Wert thou as young as I, Juliet thy love,"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,3,ROMEO,3,"An hour but married, Tybalt murdered,"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,3,ROMEO,4,"Doting like me and like me banished,"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,3,ROMEO,5,"Then mightst thou speak, then mightst thou tear thy hair,"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,3,ROMEO,6,"And fall upon the ground, as I do now,"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,3,ROMEO,7,Taking the measure of an unmade grave.
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,3,FRIAR LAURENCE,1,"Arise; one knocks; good Romeo, hide thyself."
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,3,ROMEO,1,"Not I; unless the breath of heartsick groans,"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,3,ROMEO,2,"Mist-like, infold me from the search of eyes."
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,3,FRIAR LAURENCE,1,"Hark, how they knock! Who's there? Romeo, arise;"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,3,FRIAR LAURENCE,2,Thou wilt be taken. Stay awhile! Stand up;
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,3,FRIAR LAURENCE,3,"Run to my study. By and by! God's will,"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,3,FRIAR LAURENCE,4,"What simpleness is this! I come, I come!"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,3,FRIAR LAURENCE,5,Who knocks so hard? whence come you? what's your will?
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,3,NURSE,1,my errand;
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,3,NURSE,2,I come from Lady Juliet.
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,3,FRIAR LAURENCE,1,"Welcome, then."
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,3,NURSE,1,"O holy friar, O, tell me, holy friar,"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,3,NURSE,2,"Where is my lady's lord, where's Romeo?"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,3,FRIAR LAURENCE,1,"There on the ground, with his own tears made drunk."
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,3,NURSE,1,"O, he is even in my mistress' case,"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,3,NURSE,2,Just in her case! O woful sympathy!
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,3,NURSE,3,"Piteous predicament! Even so lies she,"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,3,NURSE,4,"Blubbering and weeping, weeping and blubbering."
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,3,NURSE,5,"Stand up, stand up; stand, and you be a man:"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,3,NURSE,6,"For Juliet's sake, for her sake, rise and stand;"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,3,NURSE,7,Why should you fall into so deep an O?
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,3,ROMEO,1,Nurse!
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,3,NURSE,1,"Ah sir! ah sir! Well, death's the end of all."
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,3,ROMEO,1,Spakest thou of Juliet? how is it with her?
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,3,ROMEO,2,"Doth she not think me an old murderer,"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,3,ROMEO,3,Now I have stain'd the childhood of our joy
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,3,ROMEO,4,With blood removed but little from her own?
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,3,ROMEO,5,Where is she? and how doth she? and what says
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,3,ROMEO,6,My conceal'd lady to our cancell'd love?
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,3,NURSE,1,"O, she says nothing, sir, but weeps and weeps;"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,3,NURSE,2,"And now falls on her bed; and then starts up,"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,3,NURSE,3,"And Tybalt calls; and then on Romeo cries,"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,3,NURSE,4,And then down falls again.
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,3,ROMEO,1,"As if that name,"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,3,ROMEO,2,"Shot from the deadly level of a gun,"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,3,ROMEO,3,Did murder her; as that name's cursed hand
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,3,ROMEO,4,"Murder'd her kinsman. O, tell me, friar, tell me,"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,3,ROMEO,5,In what vile part of this anatomy
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,3,ROMEO,6,"Doth my name lodge? tell me, that I may sack"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,3,ROMEO,7,The hateful mansion.
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,3,FRIAR LAURENCE,1,Hold thy desperate hand:
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,3,FRIAR LAURENCE,2,Art thou a man? thy form cries out thou art:
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,3,FRIAR LAURENCE,3,Thy tears are womanish; thy wild acts denote
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,3,FRIAR LAURENCE,4,The unreasonable fury of a beast:
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,3,FRIAR LAURENCE,5,Unseemly woman in a seeming man!
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,3,FRIAR LAURENCE,6,Or ill-beseeming beast in seeming both!
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,3,FRIAR LAURENCE,7,"Thou hast amazed me: by my holy order,"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,3,FRIAR LAURENCE,8,I thought thy disposition better temper'd.
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,3,FRIAR LAURENCE,9,Hast thou slain Tybalt? wilt thou slay thyself?
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,3,FRIAR LAURENCE,10,"And stay thy lady too that lives in thee,"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,3,FRIAR LAURENCE,11,By doing damned hate upon thyself?
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,3,FRIAR LAURENCE,12,"Why rail'st thou on thy birth, the heaven, and earth?"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,3,FRIAR LAURENCE,13,"Since birth, and heaven, and earth, all three do meet"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,3,FRIAR LAURENCE,14,In thee at once; which thou at once wouldst lose.
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,3,FRIAR LAURENCE,15,"Fie, fie, thou shamest thy shape, thy love, thy wit;"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,3,FRIAR LAURENCE,16,"Which, like a usurer, abound'st in all,"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,3,FRIAR LAURENCE,17,And usest none in that true use indeed
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,3,FRIAR LAURENCE,18,"Which should bedeck thy shape, thy love, thy wit:"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,3,FRIAR LAURENCE,19,"Thy noble shape is but a form of wax,"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,3,FRIAR LAURENCE,20,Digressing from the valour of a man;
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,3,FRIAR LAURENCE,21,"Thy dear love sworn but hollow perjury,"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,3,FRIAR LAURENCE,22,Killing that love which thou hast vow'd to cherish;
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,3,FRIAR LAURENCE,23,"Thy wit, that ornament to shape and love,"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,3,FRIAR LAURENCE,24,"Misshapen in the conduct of them both,"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,3,FRIAR LAURENCE,25,"Like powder in a skitless soldier's flask,"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,3,FRIAR LAURENCE,26,"Is set afire by thine own ignorance,"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,3,FRIAR LAURENCE,27,And thou dismember'd with thine own defence.
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,3,FRIAR LAURENCE,28,"What, rouse thee, man! thy Juliet is alive,"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,3,FRIAR LAURENCE,29,For whose dear sake thou wast but lately dead;
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,3,FRIAR LAURENCE,30,"There art thou happy: Tybalt would kill thee,"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,3,FRIAR LAURENCE,31,But thou slew'st Tybalt; there are thou happy too:
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,3,FRIAR LAURENCE,32,The law that threaten'd death becomes thy friend
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,3,FRIAR LAURENCE,33,And turns it to exile; there art thou happy:
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,3,FRIAR LAURENCE,34,A pack of blessings lights up upon thy back;
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,3,FRIAR LAURENCE,35,Happiness courts thee in her best array;
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,3,FRIAR LAURENCE,36,"But, like a misbehaved and sullen wench,"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,3,FRIAR LAURENCE,37,Thou pout'st upon thy fortune and thy love:
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,3,FRIAR LAURENCE,38,"Take heed, take heed, for such die miserable."
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,3,FRIAR LAURENCE,39,"Go, get thee to thy love, as was decreed,"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,3,FRIAR LAURENCE,40,"Ascend her chamber, hence and comfort her:"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,3,FRIAR LAURENCE,41,"But look thou stay not till the watch be set,"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,3,FRIAR LAURENCE,42,For then thou canst not pass to Mantua;
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,3,FRIAR LAURENCE,43,"Where thou shalt live, till we can find a time"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,3,FRIAR LAURENCE,44,"To blaze your marriage, reconcile your friends,"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,3,FRIAR LAURENCE,45,"Beg pardon of the prince, and call thee back"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,3,FRIAR LAURENCE,46,With twenty hundred thousand times more joy
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,3,FRIAR LAURENCE,47,Than thou went'st forth in lamentation.
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,3,FRIAR LAURENCE,48,"Go before, nurse: commend me to thy lady;"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,3,FRIAR LAURENCE,49,"And bid her hasten all the house to bed,"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,3,FRIAR LAURENCE,50,Which heavy sorrow makes them apt unto:
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,3,FRIAR LAURENCE,51,Romeo is coming.
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,3,NURSE,1,"O Lord, I could have stay'd here all the night"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,3,NURSE,2,"To hear good counsel: O, what learning is!"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,3,NURSE,3,"My lord, I'll tell my lady you will come."
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,3,ROMEO,1,"Do so, and bid my sweet prepare to chide."
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,3,NURSE,1,"Here, sir, a ring she bid me give you, sir:"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,3,NURSE,2,"Hie you, make haste, for it grows very late."
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,3,ROMEO,1,How well my comfort is revived by this!
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,3,FRIAR LAURENCE,1,Go hence; good night; and here stands all your state:
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,3,FRIAR LAURENCE,2,"Either be gone before the watch be set,"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,3,FRIAR LAURENCE,3,Or by the break of day disguised from hence:
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,3,FRIAR LAURENCE,4,"Sojourn in Mantua; I'll find out your man,"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,3,FRIAR LAURENCE,5,And he shall signify from time to time
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,3,FRIAR LAURENCE,6,Every good hap to you that chances here:
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,3,FRIAR LAURENCE,7,Give me thy hand; 'tis late: farewell; good night.
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,3,ROMEO,1,"But that a joy past joy calls out on me,"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,3,ROMEO,2,"It were a grief, so brief to part with thee: Farewell."
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,4,CAPULET,1,"Things have fall'n out, sir, so unluckily,"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,4,CAPULET,2,That we have had no time to move our daughter:
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,4,CAPULET,3,"Look you, she loved her kinsman Tybalt dearly,"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,4,CAPULET,4,"And so did I:--Well, we were born to die."
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,4,CAPULET,5,"'Tis very late, she'll not come down to-night:"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,4,CAPULET,6,"I promise you, but for your company,"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,4,CAPULET,7,I would have been a-bed an hour ago.
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,4,PARIS,1,These times of woe afford no time to woo.
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,4,PARIS,2,"Madam, good night: commend me to your daughter."
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,4,LADY CAPULET,1,"I will, and know her mind early to-morrow;"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,4,LADY CAPULET,2,To-night she is mew'd up to her heaviness.
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,4,CAPULET,1,"Sir Paris, I will make a desperate tender"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,4,CAPULET,2,Of my child's love: I think she will be ruled
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,4,CAPULET,3,"In all respects by me; nay, more, I doubt it not."
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,4,CAPULET,4,"Wife, go you to her ere you go to bed;"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,4,CAPULET,5,Acquaint her here of my son Paris' love;
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,4,CAPULET,6,"And bid her, mark you me, on Wednesday next--"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,4,CAPULET,7,"But, soft! what day is this?"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,4,PARIS,1,"Monday, my lord,"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,4,CAPULET,1,"Monday! ha, ha! Well, Wednesday is too soon,"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,4,CAPULET,2,"O' Thursday let it be: o' Thursday, tell her,"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,4,CAPULET,3,She shall be married to this noble earl.
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,4,CAPULET,4,Will you be ready? do you like this haste?
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,4,CAPULET,5,"We'll keep no great ado,--a friend or two;"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,4,CAPULET,6,"For, hark you, Tybalt being slain so late,"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,4,CAPULET,7,"It may be thought we held him carelessly,"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,4,CAPULET,8,"Being our kinsman, if we revel much:"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,4,CAPULET,9,"Therefore we'll have some half a dozen friends,"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,4,CAPULET,10,And there an end. But what say you to Thursday?
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,4,PARIS,1,"My lord, I would that Thursday were to-morrow."
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,4,CAPULET,1,"Well get you gone: o' Thursday be it, then."
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,4,CAPULET,2,"Go you to Juliet ere you go to bed,"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,4,CAPULET,3,"Prepare her, wife, against this wedding-day."
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,4,CAPULET,4,"Farewell, my lord. Light to my chamber, ho!"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,4,CAPULET,5,"Afore me! it is so very very late,"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,4,CAPULET,6,That we may call it early by and by.
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,4,CAPULET,7,Good night.
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,5,JULIET,1,Wilt thou be gone? it is not yet near day:
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,5,JULIET,2,"It was the nightingale, and not the lark,"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,5,JULIET,3,That pierced the fearful hollow of thine ear;
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,5,JULIET,4,Nightly she sings on yon pomegranate-tree:
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,5,JULIET,5,"Believe me, love, it was the nightingale."
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,5,ROMEO,1,"It was the lark, the herald of the morn,"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,5,ROMEO,2,"No nightingale: look, love, what envious streaks"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,5,ROMEO,3,Do lace the severing clouds in yonder east:
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,5,ROMEO,4,"Night's candles are burnt out, and jocund day"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,5,ROMEO,5,Stands tiptoe on the misty mountain tops.
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,5,ROMEO,6,"I must be gone and live, or stay and die."
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,5,JULIET,1,"Yon light is not day-light, I know it, I:"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,5,JULIET,2,"It is some meteor that the sun exhales,"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,5,JULIET,3,"To be to thee this night a torch-bearer,"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,5,JULIET,4,And light thee on thy way to Mantua:
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,5,JULIET,5,Therefore stay yet; thou need'st not to be gone.
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,5,ROMEO,1,"Let me be ta'en, let me be put to death;"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,5,ROMEO,2,"I am content, so thou wilt have it so."
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,5,ROMEO,3,"I'll say yon grey is not the morning's eye,"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,5,ROMEO,4,'Tis but the pale reflex of Cynthia's brow;
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,5,ROMEO,5,"Nor that is not the lark, whose notes do beat"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,5,ROMEO,6,The vaulty heaven so high above our heads:
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,5,ROMEO,7,I have more care to stay than will to go:
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,5,ROMEO,8,"Come, death, and welcome! Juliet wills it so."
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,5,ROMEO,9,"How is't, my soul? let's talk; it is not day."
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,5,JULIET,1,"It is, it is: hie hence, be gone, away!"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,5,JULIET,2,"It is the lark that sings so out of tune,"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,5,JULIET,3,Straining harsh discords and unpleasing sharps.
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,5,JULIET,4,Some say the lark makes sweet division;
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,5,JULIET,5,"This doth not so, for she divideth us:"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,5,JULIET,6,"Some say the lark and loathed toad change eyes,"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,5,JULIET,7,"O, now I would they had changed voices too!"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,5,JULIET,8,"Since arm from arm that voice doth us affray,"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,5,JULIET,9,"Hunting thee hence with hunt's-up to the day,"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,5,JULIET,10,"O, now be gone; more light and light it grows."
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,5,ROMEO,1,More light and light; more dark and dark our woes!
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,5,NURSE,1,Madam!
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,5,JULIET,1,Nurse?
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,5,NURSE,1,Your lady mother is coming to your chamber:
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,5,NURSE,2,"The day is broke; be wary, look about."
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,5,JULIET,1,"Then, window, let day in, and let life out."
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,5,ROMEO,1,"Farewell, farewell! one kiss, and I'll descend."
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,5,JULIET,1,"Art thou gone so? love, lord, ay, husband, friend!"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,5,JULIET,2,"I must hear from thee every day in the hour,"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,5,JULIET,3,For in a minute there are many days:
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,5,JULIET,4,"O, by this count I shall be much in years"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,5,JULIET,5,Ere I again behold my Romeo!
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,5,ROMEO,1,Farewell!
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,5,ROMEO,2,I will omit no opportunity
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,5,ROMEO,3,"That may convey my greetings, love, to thee."
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,5,JULIET,1,O think'st thou we shall ever meet again?
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,5,ROMEO,1,I doubt it not; and all these woes shall serve
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,5,ROMEO,2,For sweet discourses in our time to come.
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,5,JULIET,1,"O God, I have an ill-divining soul!"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,5,JULIET,2,"Methinks I see thee, now thou art below,"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,5,JULIET,3,As one dead in the bottom of a tomb:
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,5,JULIET,4,"Either my eyesight fails, or thou look'st pale."
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,5,ROMEO,1,"And trust me, love, in my eye so do you:"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,5,ROMEO,2,"Dry sorrow drinks our blood. Adieu, adieu!"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,5,JULIET,1,"O fortune, fortune! all men call thee fickle:"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,5,JULIET,2,"If thou art fickle, what dost thou with him."
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,5,JULIET,3,"That is renown'd for faith? Be fickle, fortune;"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,5,JULIET,4,"For then, I hope, thou wilt not keep him long,"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,5,JULIET,5,But send him back.
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,5,JULIET,1,Who is't that calls? is it my lady mother?
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,5,JULIET,2,"Is she not down so late, or up so early?"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,5,JULIET,3,What unaccustom'd cause procures her hither?
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,5,LADY CAPULET,1,"Why, how now, Juliet!"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,5,JULIET,1,"Madam, I am not well."
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,5,LADY CAPULET,1,Evermore weeping for your cousin's death?
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,5,LADY CAPULET,2,"What, wilt thou wash him from his grave with tears?"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,5,LADY CAPULET,3,"An if thou couldst, thou couldst not make him live;"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,5,LADY CAPULET,4,"Therefore, have done: some grief shows much of love;"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,5,LADY CAPULET,5,But much of grief shows still some want of wit.
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,5,JULIET,1,Yet let me weep for such a feeling loss.
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,5,LADY CAPULET,1,"So shall you feel the loss, but not the friend"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,5,LADY CAPULET,2,Which you weep for.
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,5,JULIET,1,"Feeling so the loss,"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,5,JULIET,2,Cannot choose but ever weep the friend.
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,5,LADY CAPULET,1,"Well, girl, thou weep'st not so much for his death,"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,5,LADY CAPULET,2,As that the villain lives which slaughter'd him.
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,5,JULIET,1,What villain madam?
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,5,LADY CAPULET,1,"That same villain, Romeo."
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,5,JULIET,1,"God Pardon him! I do, with all my heart;"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,5,JULIET,2,And yet no man like he doth grieve my heart.
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,5,LADY CAPULET,1,"That is, because the traitor murderer lives."
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,5,JULIET,1,"Ay, madam, from the reach of these my hands:"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,5,JULIET,2,Would none but I might venge my cousin's death!
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,5,LADY CAPULET,1,"We will have vengeance for it, fear thou not:"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,5,LADY CAPULET,2,"Then weep no more. I'll send to one in Mantua,"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,5,LADY CAPULET,3,"Where that same banish'd runagate doth live,"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,5,LADY CAPULET,4,"Shall give him such an unaccustom'd dram,"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,5,LADY CAPULET,5,That he shall soon keep Tybalt company:
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,5,LADY CAPULET,6,"And then, I hope, thou wilt be satisfied."
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,5,JULIET,1,"Indeed, I never shall be satisfied"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,5,JULIET,2,"With Romeo, till I behold him--dead--"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,5,JULIET,3,Is my poor heart for a kinsman vex'd.
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,5,JULIET,4,"Madam, if you could find out but a man"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,5,JULIET,5,"To bear a poison, I would temper it;"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,5,JULIET,6,"That Romeo should, upon receipt thereof,"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,5,JULIET,7,"Soon sleep in quiet. O, how my heart abhors"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,5,JULIET,8,"To hear him named, and cannot come to him."
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,5,JULIET,9,To wreak the love I bore my cousin
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,5,JULIET,10,Upon his body that slaughter'd him!
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,5,LADY CAPULET,1,"Find thou the means, and I'll find such a man."
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,5,LADY CAPULET,2,"But now I'll tell thee joyful tidings, girl."
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,5,JULIET,1,And joy comes well in such a needy time:
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,5,JULIET,2,"What are they, I beseech your ladyship?"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,5,LADY CAPULET,1,"Well, well, thou hast a careful father, child;"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,5,LADY CAPULET,2,"One who, to put thee from thy heaviness,"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,5,LADY CAPULET,3,"Hath sorted out a sudden day of joy,"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,5,LADY CAPULET,4,That thou expect'st not nor I look'd not for.
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,5,JULIET,1,"Madam, in happy time, what day is that?"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,5,LADY CAPULET,1,"Marry, my child, early next Thursday morn,"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,5,LADY CAPULET,2,"The gallant, young and noble gentleman,"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,5,LADY CAPULET,3,"The County Paris, at Saint Peter's Church,"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,5,LADY CAPULET,4,Shall happily make thee there a joyful bride.
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,5,JULIET,1,"Now, by Saint Peter's Church and Peter too,"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,5,JULIET,2,He shall not make me there a joyful bride.
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,5,JULIET,3,I wonder at this haste; that I must wed
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,5,JULIET,4,"Ere he, that should be husband, comes to woo."
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,5,JULIET,5,"I pray you, tell my lord and father, madam,"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,5,JULIET,6,"I will not marry yet; and, when I do, I swear,"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,5,JULIET,7,"It shall be Romeo, whom you know I hate,"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,5,JULIET,8,Rather than Paris. These are news indeed!
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,5,LADY CAPULET,1,"Here comes your father; tell him so yourself,"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,5,LADY CAPULET,2,And see how he will take it at your hands.
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,5,CAPULET,1,"When the sun sets, the air doth drizzle dew;"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,5,CAPULET,2,But for the sunset of my brother's son
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,5,CAPULET,3,It rains downright.
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,5,CAPULET,4,"How now! a conduit, girl? what, still in tears?"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,5,CAPULET,5,Evermore showering? In one little body
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,5,CAPULET,6,"Thou counterfeit'st a bark, a sea, a wind;"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,5,CAPULET,7,"For still thy eyes, which I may call the sea,"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,5,CAPULET,8,"Do ebb and flow with tears; the bark thy body is,"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,5,CAPULET,9,"Sailing in this salt flood; the winds, thy sighs;"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,5,CAPULET,10,"Who, raging with thy tears, and they with them,"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,5,CAPULET,11,"Without a sudden calm, will overset"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,5,CAPULET,12,"Thy tempest-tossed body. How now, wife!"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,5,CAPULET,13,Have you deliver'd to her our decree?
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,5,LADY CAPULET,1,"Ay, sir; but she will none, she gives you thanks."
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,5,LADY CAPULET,2,I would the fool were married to her grave!
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,5,CAPULET,1,"Soft! take me with you, take me with you, wife."
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,5,CAPULET,2,How! will she none? doth she not give us thanks?
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,5,CAPULET,3,"Is she not proud? doth she not count her blest,"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,5,CAPULET,4,"Unworthy as she is, that we have wrought"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,5,CAPULET,5,So worthy a gentleman to be her bridegroom?
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,5,JULIET,1,"Not proud, you have; but thankful, that you have:"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,5,JULIET,2,Proud can I never be of what I hate;
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,5,JULIET,3,"But thankful even for hate, that is meant love."
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,5,CAPULET,1,"How now, how now, chop-logic! What is this?"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,5,CAPULET,2,"'Proud,' and 'I thank you,' and 'I thank you not;'"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,5,CAPULET,3,"And yet 'not proud,' mistress minion, you,"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,5,CAPULET,4,"Thank me no thankings, nor, proud me no prouds,"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,5,CAPULET,5,"But fettle your fine joints 'gainst Thursday next,"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,5,CAPULET,6,"To go with Paris to Saint Peter's Church,"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,5,CAPULET,7,Or I will drag thee on a hurdle thither.
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,5,CAPULET,8,"Out, you green-sickness carrion! out, you baggage!"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,5,CAPULET,9,You tallow-face!
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,5,LADY CAPULET,1,"Fie, fie! what, are you mad?"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,5,JULIET,1,"Good father, I beseech you on my knees,"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,5,JULIET,2,Hear me with patience but to speak a word.
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,5,CAPULET,1,"Hang thee, young baggage! disobedient wretch!"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,5,CAPULET,2,"I tell thee what: get thee to church o' Thursday,"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,5,CAPULET,3,Or never after look me in the face:
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,5,CAPULET,4,"Speak not, reply not, do not answer me;"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,5,CAPULET,5,"My fingers itch. Wife, we scarce thought us blest"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,5,CAPULET,6,That God had lent us but this only child;
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,5,CAPULET,7,"But now I see this one is one too much,"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,5,CAPULET,8,And that we have a curse in having her:
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,5,CAPULET,9,"Out on her, hilding!"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,5,NURSE,1,God in heaven bless her!
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,5,NURSE,2,"You are to blame, my lord, to rate her so."
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,5,CAPULET,1,"And why, my lady wisdom? hold your tongue,"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,5,CAPULET,2,"Good prudence; smatter with your gossips, go."
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,5,NURSE,1,I speak no treason.
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,5,CAPULET,1,"O, God ye god-den."
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,5,NURSE,1,May not one speak?
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,5,CAPULET,1,"Peace, you mumbling fool!"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,5,CAPULET,2,Utter your gravity o'er a gossip's bowl;
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,5,CAPULET,3,For here we need it not.
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,5,LADY CAPULET,1,You are too hot.
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,5,CAPULET,1,God's bread! it makes me mad:
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,5,CAPULET,2,"Day, night, hour, tide, time, work, play,"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,5,CAPULET,3,"Alone, in company, still my care hath been"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,5,CAPULET,4,To have her match'd: and having now provided
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,5,CAPULET,5,"A gentleman of noble parentage,"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,5,CAPULET,6,"Of fair demesnes, youthful, and nobly train'd,"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,5,CAPULET,7,"Stuff'd, as they say, with honourable parts,"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,5,CAPULET,8,Proportion'd as one's thought would wish a man;
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,5,CAPULET,9,"And then to have a wretched puling fool,"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,5,CAPULET,10,"A whining mammet, in her fortune's tender,"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,5,CAPULET,11,"To answer 'I'll not wed; I cannot love,"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,5,CAPULET,12,"I am too young; I pray you, pardon me.'"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,5,CAPULET,13,"But, as you will not wed, I'll pardon you:"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,5,CAPULET,14,Graze where you will you shall not house with me:
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,5,CAPULET,15,"Look to't, think on't, I do not use to jest."
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,5,CAPULET,16,"Thursday is near; lay hand on heart, advise:"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,5,CAPULET,17,"An you be mine, I'll give you to my friend;"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,5,CAPULET,18,"And you be not, hang, beg, starve, die in"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,5,CAPULET,19,"the streets,"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,5,CAPULET,20,"For, by my soul, I'll ne'er acknowledge thee,"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,5,CAPULET,21,Nor what is mine shall never do thee good:
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,5,CAPULET,22,"Trust to't, bethink you; I'll not be forsworn."
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,5,JULIET,1,"Is there no pity sitting in the clouds,"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,5,JULIET,2,That sees into the bottom of my grief?
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,5,JULIET,3,"O, sweet my mother, cast me not away!"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,5,JULIET,4,"Delay this marriage for a month, a week;"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,5,JULIET,5,"Or, if you do not, make the bridal bed"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,5,JULIET,6,In that dim monument where Tybalt lies.
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,5,LADY CAPULET,1,"Talk not to me, for I'll not speak a word:"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,5,LADY CAPULET,2,"Do as thou wilt, for I have done with thee."
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,5,JULIET,1,"O God!--O nurse, how shall this be prevented?"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,5,JULIET,2,"My husband is on earth, my faith in heaven;"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,5,JULIET,3,"How shall that faith return again to earth,"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,5,JULIET,4,Unless that husband send it me from heaven
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,5,JULIET,5,"By leaving earth? comfort me, counsel me."
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,5,JULIET,6,"Alack, alack, that heaven should practise stratagems"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,5,JULIET,7,Upon so soft a subject as myself!
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,5,JULIET,8,What say'st thou? hast thou not a word of joy?
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,5,JULIET,9,"Some comfort, nurse."
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,5,NURSE,1,"Faith, here it is."
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,5,NURSE,2,"Romeo is banish'd; and all the world to nothing,"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,5,NURSE,3,That he dares ne'er come back to challenge you;
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,5,NURSE,4,"Or, if he do, it needs must be by stealth."
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,5,NURSE,5,"Then, since the case so stands as now it doth,"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,5,NURSE,6,I think it best you married with the county.
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,5,NURSE,7,"O, he's a lovely gentleman!"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,5,NURSE,8,"Romeo's a dishclout to him: an eagle, madam,"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,5,NURSE,9,"Hath not so green, so quick, so fair an eye"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,5,NURSE,10,"As Paris hath. Beshrew my very heart,"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,5,NURSE,11,"I think you are happy in this second match,"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,5,NURSE,12,"For it excels your first: or if it did not,"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,5,NURSE,13,"Your first is dead; or 'twere as good he were,"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,5,NURSE,14,As living here and you no use of him.
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,5,JULIET,1,Speakest thou from thy heart?
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,5,NURSE,1,And from my soul too;
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,5,NURSE,2,Or else beshrew them both.
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,5,JULIET,1,Amen!
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,5,NURSE,1,What?
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,5,JULIET,1,"Well, thou hast comforted me marvellous much."
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,5,JULIET,2,"Go in: and tell my lady I am gone,"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,5,JULIET,3,"Having displeased my father, to Laurence' cell,"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,5,JULIET,4,To make confession and to be absolved.
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,5,NURSE,1,"Marry, I will; and this is wisely done."
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,5,JULIET,1,Ancient damnation! O most wicked fiend!
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,5,JULIET,2,"Is it more sin to wish me thus forsworn,"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,5,JULIET,3,Or to dispraise my lord with that same tongue
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,5,JULIET,4,Which she hath praised him with above compare
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,5,JULIET,5,"So many thousand times? Go, counsellor;"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,5,JULIET,6,Thou and my bosom henceforth shall be twain.
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,5,JULIET,7,"I'll to the friar, to know his remedy:"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,3,5,JULIET,8,"If all else fail, myself have power to die."
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,4,1,FRIAR LAURENCE,1,"On Thursday, sir? the time is very short."
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,4,1,PARIS,1,My father Capulet will have it so;
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,4,1,PARIS,2,And I am nothing slow to slack his haste.
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,4,1,FRIAR LAURENCE,1,You say you do not know the lady's mind:
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,4,1,FRIAR LAURENCE,2,"Uneven is the course, I like it not."
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,4,1,PARIS,1,"Immoderately she weeps for Tybalt's death,"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,4,1,PARIS,2,And therefore have I little talk'd of love;
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,4,1,PARIS,3,For Venus smiles not in a house of tears.
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,4,1,PARIS,4,"Now, sir, her father counts it dangerous"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,4,1,PARIS,5,"That she doth give her sorrow so much sway,"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,4,1,PARIS,6,"And in his wisdom hastes our marriage,"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,4,1,PARIS,7,To stop the inundation of her tears;
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,4,1,PARIS,8,"Which, too much minded by herself alone,"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,4,1,PARIS,9,May be put from her by society:
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,4,1,PARIS,10,Now do you know the reason of this haste.
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,4,1,FRIAR LAURENCE,1,"Look, sir, here comes the lady towards my cell."
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,4,1,PARIS,1,"Happily met, my lady and my wife!"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,4,1,JULIET,1,"That may be, sir, when I may be a wife."
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,4,1,PARIS,1,"That may be must be, love, on Thursday next."
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,4,1,JULIET,1,What must be shall be.
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,4,1,FRIAR LAURENCE,1,That's a certain text.
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,4,1,PARIS,1,Come you to make confession to this father?
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,4,1,JULIET,1,"To answer that, I should confess to you."
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,4,1,PARIS,1,Do not deny to him that you love me.
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,4,1,JULIET,1,I will confess to you that I love him.
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,4,1,PARIS,1,"So will ye, I am sure, that you love me."
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,4,1,JULIET,1,"If I do so, it will be of more price,"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,4,1,JULIET,2,"Being spoke behind your back, than to your face."
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,4,1,PARIS,1,"Poor soul, thy face is much abused with tears."
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,4,1,JULIET,1,The tears have got small victory by that;
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,4,1,JULIET,2,For it was bad enough before their spite.
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,4,1,PARIS,1,"Thou wrong'st it, more than tears, with that report."
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,4,1,JULIET,1,"That is no slander, sir, which is a truth;"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,4,1,JULIET,2,"And what I spake, I spake it to my face."
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,4,1,PARIS,1,"Thy face is mine, and thou hast slander'd it."
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,4,1,JULIET,1,"It may be so, for it is not mine own."
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,4,1,JULIET,2,"Are you at leisure, holy father, now;"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,4,1,JULIET,3,Or shall I come to you at evening mass?
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,4,1,FRIAR LAURENCE,1,"My leisure serves me, pensive daughter, now."
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,4,1,FRIAR LAURENCE,2,"My lord, we must entreat the time alone."
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,4,1,PARIS,1,God shield I should disturb devotion!
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,4,1,PARIS,2,"Juliet, on Thursday early will I rouse ye:"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,4,1,PARIS,3,"Till then, adieu; and keep this holy kiss."
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,4,1,JULIET,1,"O shut the door! and when thou hast done so,"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,4,1,JULIET,2,"Come weep with me; past hope, past cure, past help!"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,4,1,FRIAR LAURENCE,1,"Ah, Juliet, I already know thy grief;"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,4,1,FRIAR LAURENCE,2,It strains me past the compass of my wits:
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,4,1,FRIAR LAURENCE,3,"I hear thou must, and nothing may prorogue it,"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,4,1,FRIAR LAURENCE,4,On Thursday next be married to this county.
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,4,1,JULIET,1,"Tell me not, friar, that thou hear'st of this,"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,4,1,JULIET,2,Unless thou tell me how I may prevent it:
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,4,1,JULIET,3,"If, in thy wisdom, thou canst give no help,"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,4,1,JULIET,4,"Do thou but call my resolution wise,"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,4,1,JULIET,5,And with this knife I'll help it presently.
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,4,1,JULIET,6,"God join'd my heart and Romeo's, thou our hands;"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,4,1,JULIET,7,"And ere this hand, by thee to Romeo seal'd,"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,4,1,JULIET,8,"Shall be the label to another deed,"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,4,1,JULIET,9,Or my true heart with treacherous revolt
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,4,1,JULIET,10,"Turn to another, this shall slay them both:"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,4,1,JULIET,11,"Therefore, out of thy long-experienced time,"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,4,1,JULIET,12,"Give me some present counsel, or, behold,"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,4,1,JULIET,13,'Twixt my extremes and me this bloody knife
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,4,1,JULIET,14,"Shall play the umpire, arbitrating that"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,4,1,JULIET,15,Which the commission of thy years and art
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,4,1,JULIET,16,Could to no issue of true honour bring.
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,4,1,JULIET,17,"Be not so long to speak; I long to die,"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,4,1,JULIET,18,If what thou speak'st speak not of remedy.
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,4,1,FRIAR LAURENCE,1,"Hold, daughter: I do spy a kind of hope,"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,4,1,FRIAR LAURENCE,2,Which craves as desperate an execution.
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,4,1,FRIAR LAURENCE,3,As that is desperate which we would prevent.
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,4,1,FRIAR LAURENCE,4,"If, rather than to marry County Paris,"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,4,1,FRIAR LAURENCE,5,"Thou hast the strength of will to slay thyself,"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,4,1,FRIAR LAURENCE,6,Then is it likely thou wilt undertake
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,4,1,FRIAR LAURENCE,7,"A thing like death to chide away this shame,"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,4,1,FRIAR LAURENCE,8,That copest with death himself to scape from it:
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,4,1,FRIAR LAURENCE,9,"And, if thou darest, I'll give thee remedy."
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,4,1,JULIET,1,"O, bid me leap, rather than marry Paris,"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,4,1,JULIET,2,From off the battlements of yonder tower;
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,4,1,JULIET,3,Or walk in thievish ways; or bid me lurk
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,4,1,JULIET,4,Where serpents are; chain me with roaring bears;
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,4,1,JULIET,5,"Or shut me nightly in a charnel-house,"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,4,1,JULIET,6,"O'er-cover'd quite with dead men's rattling bones,"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,4,1,JULIET,7,With reeky shanks and yellow chapless skulls;
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,4,1,JULIET,8,Or bid me go into a new-made grave
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,4,1,JULIET,9,And hide me with a dead man in his shroud;
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,4,1,JULIET,10,"Things that, to hear them told, have made me tremble;"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,4,1,JULIET,11,"And I will do it without fear or doubt,"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,4,1,JULIET,12,To live an unstain'd wife to my sweet love.
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,4,1,FRIAR LAURENCE,1,"Hold, then; go home, be merry, give consent"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,4,1,FRIAR LAURENCE,2,To marry Paris: Wednesday is to-morrow:
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,4,1,FRIAR LAURENCE,3,To-morrow night look that thou lie alone;
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,4,1,FRIAR LAURENCE,4,Let not thy nurse lie with thee in thy chamber:
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,4,1,FRIAR LAURENCE,5,"Take thou this vial, being then in bed,"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,4,1,FRIAR LAURENCE,6,And this distilled liquor drink thou off;
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,4,1,FRIAR LAURENCE,7,When presently through all thy veins shall run
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,4,1,FRIAR LAURENCE,8,"A cold and drowsy humour, for no pulse"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,4,1,FRIAR LAURENCE,9,"Shall keep his native progress, but surcease:"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,4,1,FRIAR LAURENCE,10,"No warmth, no breath, shall testify thou livest;"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,4,1,FRIAR LAURENCE,11,The roses in thy lips and cheeks shall fade
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,4,1,FRIAR LAURENCE,12,"To paly ashes, thy eyes' windows fall,"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,4,1,FRIAR LAURENCE,13,"Like death, when he shuts up the day of life;"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,4,1,FRIAR LAURENCE,14,"Each part, deprived of supple government,"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,4,1,FRIAR LAURENCE,15,"Shall, stiff and stark and cold, appear like death:"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,4,1,FRIAR LAURENCE,16,And in this borrow'd likeness of shrunk death
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,4,1,FRIAR LAURENCE,17,"Thou shalt continue two and forty hours,"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,4,1,FRIAR LAURENCE,18,And then awake as from a pleasant sleep.
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,4,1,FRIAR LAURENCE,19,"Now, when the bridegroom in the morning comes"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,4,1,FRIAR LAURENCE,20,"To rouse thee from thy bed, there art thou dead:"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,4,1,FRIAR LAURENCE,21,"Then, as the manner of our country is,"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,4,1,FRIAR LAURENCE,22,In thy best robes uncover'd on the bier
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,4,1,FRIAR LAURENCE,23,Thou shalt be borne to that same ancient vault
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,4,1,FRIAR LAURENCE,24,Where all the kindred of the Capulets lie.
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,4,1,FRIAR LAURENCE,25,"In the mean time, against thou shalt awake,"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,4,1,FRIAR LAURENCE,26,"Shall Romeo by my letters know our drift,"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,4,1,FRIAR LAURENCE,27,And hither shall he come: and he and I
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,4,1,FRIAR LAURENCE,28,"Will watch thy waking, and that very night"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,4,1,FRIAR LAURENCE,29,Shall Romeo bear thee hence to Mantua.
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,4,1,FRIAR LAURENCE,30,And this shall free thee from this present shame;
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,4,1,FRIAR LAURENCE,31,"If no inconstant toy, nor womanish fear,"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,4,1,FRIAR LAURENCE,32,Abate thy valour in the acting it.
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,4,1,JULIET,1,"Give me, give me! O, tell not me of fear!"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,4,1,FRIAR LAURENCE,1,"Hold; get you gone, be strong and prosperous"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,4,1,FRIAR LAURENCE,2,In this resolve: I'll send a friar with speed
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,4,1,FRIAR LAURENCE,3,"To Mantua, with my letters to thy lord."
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,4,1,JULIET,1,Love give me strength! and strength shall help afford.
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,4,1,JULIET,2,"Farewell, dear father!"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,4,2,CAPULET,1,So many guests invite as here are writ.
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,4,2,CAPULET,2,"Sirrah, go hire me twenty cunning cooks."
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,4,2,SECOND SERVANT,1,"You shall have none ill, sir; for I'll try if they"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,4,2,SECOND SERVANT,2,can lick their fingers.
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,4,2,CAPULET,1,How canst thou try them so?
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,4,2,SECOND SERVANT,1,"Marry, sir, 'tis an ill cook that cannot lick his"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,4,2,SECOND SERVANT,2,own fingers: therefore he that cannot lick his
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,4,2,SECOND SERVANT,3,fingers goes not with me.
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,4,2,CAPULET,1,"Go, be gone."
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,4,2,CAPULET,2,We shall be much unfurnished for this time.
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,4,2,CAPULET,3,"What, is my daughter gone to Friar Laurence?"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,4,2,NURSE,1,"Ay, forsooth."
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,4,2,CAPULET,1,"Well, he may chance to do some good on her:"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,4,2,CAPULET,2,A peevish self-will'd harlotry it is.
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,4,2,NURSE,1,See where she comes from shrift with merry look.
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,4,2,CAPULET,1,"How now, my headstrong! where have you been gadding?"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,4,2,JULIET,1,Where I have learn'd me to repent the sin
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,4,2,JULIET,2,Of disobedient opposition
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,4,2,JULIET,3,"To you and your behests, and am enjoin'd"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,4,2,JULIET,4,"By holy Laurence to fall prostrate here,"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,4,2,JULIET,5,"And beg your pardon: pardon, I beseech you!"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,4,2,JULIET,6,Henceforward I am ever ruled by you.
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,4,2,CAPULET,1,Send for the county; go tell him of this:
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,4,2,CAPULET,2,I'll have this knot knit up to-morrow morning.
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,4,2,JULIET,1,I met the youthful lord at Laurence' cell;
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,4,2,JULIET,2,"And gave him what becomed love I might,"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,4,2,JULIET,3,Not step o'er the bounds of modesty.
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,4,2,CAPULET,1,"Why, I am glad on't; this is well: stand up:"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,4,2,CAPULET,2,This is as't should be. Let me see the county;
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,4,2,CAPULET,3,"Ay, marry, go, I say, and fetch him hither."
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,4,2,CAPULET,4,"Now, afore God! this reverend holy friar,"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,4,2,CAPULET,5,Our whole city is much bound to him.
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,4,2,JULIET,1,"Nurse, will you go with me into my closet,"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,4,2,JULIET,2,To help me sort such needful ornaments
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,4,2,JULIET,3,As you think fit to furnish me to-morrow?
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,4,2,LADY CAPULET,1,"No, not till Thursday; there is time enough."
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,4,2,CAPULET,1,"Go, nurse, go with her: we'll to church to-morrow."
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,4,2,LADY CAPULET,1,We shall be short in our provision:
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,4,2,LADY CAPULET,2,'Tis now near night.
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,4,2,CAPULET,1,"Tush, I will stir about,"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,4,2,CAPULET,2,"And all things shall be well, I warrant thee, wife:"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,4,2,CAPULET,3,"Go thou to Juliet, help to deck up her;"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,4,2,CAPULET,4,I'll not to bed to-night; let me alone;
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,4,2,CAPULET,5,"I'll play the housewife for this once. What, ho!"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,4,2,CAPULET,6,"They are all forth. Well, I will walk myself"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,4,2,CAPULET,7,"To County Paris, to prepare him up"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,4,2,CAPULET,8,"Against to-morrow: my heart is wondrous light,"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,4,2,CAPULET,9,Since this same wayward girl is so reclaim'd.
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,4,3,JULIET,1,"Ay, those attires are best: but, gentle nurse,"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,4,3,JULIET,2,"I pray thee, leave me to myself to-night,"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,4,3,JULIET,3,For I have need of many orisons
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,4,3,JULIET,4,"To move the heavens to smile upon my state,"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,4,3,JULIET,5,"Which, well thou know'st, is cross, and full of sin."
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,4,3,LADY CAPULET,1,"What, are you busy, ho? need you my help?"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,4,3,JULIET,1,"No, madam; we have cull'd such necessaries"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,4,3,JULIET,2,As are behoveful for our state to-morrow:
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,4,3,JULIET,3,"So please you, let me now be left alone,"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,4,3,JULIET,4,And let the nurse this night sit up with you;
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,4,3,JULIET,5,"For, I am sure, you have your hands full all,"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,4,3,JULIET,6,In this so sudden business.
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,4,3,LADY CAPULET,1,Good night:
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,4,3,LADY CAPULET,2,"Get thee to bed, and rest; for thou hast need."
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,4,3,JULIET,1,Farewell! God knows when we shall meet again.
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,4,3,JULIET,2,"I have a faint cold fear thrills through my veins,"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,4,3,JULIET,3,That almost freezes up the heat of life:
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,4,3,JULIET,4,I'll call them back again to comfort me:
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,4,3,JULIET,5,Nurse! What should she do here?
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,4,3,JULIET,6,My dismal scene I needs must act alone.
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,4,3,JULIET,7,"Come, vial."
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,4,3,JULIET,8,What if this mixture do not work at all?
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,4,3,JULIET,9,Shall I be married then to-morrow morning?
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,4,3,JULIET,10,"No, no: this shall forbid it: lie thou there."
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,4,3,JULIET,11,"What if it be a poison, which the friar"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,4,3,JULIET,12,"Subtly hath minister'd to have me dead,"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,4,3,JULIET,13,"Lest in this marriage he should be dishonour'd,"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,4,3,JULIET,14,Because he married me before to Romeo?
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,4,3,JULIET,15,"I fear it is: and yet, methinks, it should not,"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,4,3,JULIET,16,For he hath still been tried a holy man.
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,4,3,JULIET,17,"How if, when I am laid into the tomb,"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,4,3,JULIET,18,I wake before the time that Romeo
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,4,3,JULIET,19,Come to redeem me? there's a fearful point!
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,4,3,JULIET,20,"Shall I not, then, be stifled in the vault,"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,4,3,JULIET,21,"To whose foul mouth no healthsome air breathes in,"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,4,3,JULIET,22,And there die strangled ere my Romeo comes?
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,4,3,JULIET,23,"Or, if I live, is it not very like,"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,4,3,JULIET,24,"The horrible conceit of death and night,"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,4,3,JULIET,25,"Together with the terror of the place,--"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,4,3,JULIET,26,"As in a vault, an ancient receptacle,"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,4,3,JULIET,27,"Where, for these many hundred years, the bones"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,4,3,JULIET,28,Of all my buried ancestors are packed:
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,4,3,JULIET,29,"Where bloody Tybalt, yet but green in earth,"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,4,3,JULIET,30,"Lies festering in his shroud; where, as they say,"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,4,3,JULIET,31,At some hours in the night spirits resort;--
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,4,3,JULIET,32,"Alack, alack, is it not like that I,"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,4,3,JULIET,33,"So early waking, what with loathsome smells,"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,4,3,JULIET,34,"And shrieks like mandrakes' torn out of the earth,"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,4,3,JULIET,35,"That living mortals, hearing them, run mad:--"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,4,3,JULIET,36,"O, if I wake, shall I not be distraught,"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,4,3,JULIET,37,Environed with all these hideous fears?
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,4,3,JULIET,38,And madly play with my forefather's joints?
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,4,3,JULIET,39,And pluck the mangled Tybalt from his shroud?
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,4,3,JULIET,40,"And, in this rage, with some great kinsman's bone,"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,4,3,JULIET,41,"As with a club, dash out my desperate brains?"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,4,3,JULIET,42,"O, look! methinks I see my cousin's ghost"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,4,3,JULIET,43,"Seeking out Romeo, that did spit his body"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,4,3,JULIET,44,"Upon a rapier's point: stay, Tybalt, stay!"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,4,3,JULIET,45,"Romeo, I come! this do I drink to thee."
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,4,4,LADY CAPULET,1,"Hold, take these keys, and fetch more spices, nurse."
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,4,4,NURSE,1,They call for dates and quinces in the pastry.
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,4,4,CAPULET,1,"Come, stir, stir, stir! the second cock hath crow'd,"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,4,4,CAPULET,2,"The curfew-bell hath rung, 'tis three o'clock:"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,4,4,CAPULET,3,"Look to the baked meats, good Angelica:"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,4,4,CAPULET,4,Spare not for the cost.
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,4,4,NURSE,1,"Go, you cot-quean, go,"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,4,4,NURSE,2,"Get you to bed; faith, You'll be sick to-morrow"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,4,4,NURSE,3,For this night's watching.
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,4,4,CAPULET,1,"No, not a whit: what! I have watch'd ere now"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,4,4,CAPULET,2,"All night for lesser cause, and ne'er been sick."
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,4,4,LADY CAPULET,1,"Ay, you have been a mouse-hunt in your time;"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,4,4,LADY CAPULET,2,But I will watch you from such watching now.
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,4,4,CAPULET,1,"A jealous hood, a jealous hood!"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,4,4,CAPULET,2,"Now, fellow,"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,4,4,CAPULET,3,What's there?
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,4,4,FIRST SERVANT,1,"Things for the cook, sir; but I know not what."
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,4,4,CAPULET,1,"Make haste, make haste."
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,4,4,CAPULET,2,"Sirrah, fetch drier logs:"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,4,4,CAPULET,3,"Call Peter, he will show thee where they are."
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,4,4,SECOND SERVANT,1,"I have a head, sir, that will find out logs,"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,4,4,SECOND SERVANT,2,And never trouble Peter for the matter.
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,4,4,CAPULET,1,"Mass, and well said; a merry whoreson, ha!"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,4,4,CAPULET,2,"Thou shalt be logger-head. Good faith, 'tis day:"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,4,4,CAPULET,3,"The county will be here with music straight,"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,4,4,CAPULET,4,For so he said he would: I hear him near.
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,4,4,CAPULET,5,"Nurse! Wife! What, ho! What, nurse, I say!"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,4,4,CAPULET,6,"Go waken Juliet, go and trim her up;"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,4,4,CAPULET,7,"I'll go and chat with Paris: hie, make haste,"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,4,4,CAPULET,8,Make haste; the bridegroom he is come already:
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,4,4,CAPULET,9,"Make haste, I say."
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,4,5,NURSE,1,"Mistress! what, mistress! Juliet! fast, I warrant her, she:"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,4,5,NURSE,2,"Why, lamb! why, lady! fie, you slug-a-bed!"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,4,5,NURSE,3,"Why, love, I say! madam! sweet-heart! why, bride!"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,4,5,NURSE,4,"What, not a word? you take your pennyworths now;"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,4,5,NURSE,5,"Sleep for a week; for the next night, I warrant,"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,4,5,NURSE,6,"The County Paris hath set up his rest,"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,4,5,NURSE,7,"That you shall rest but little. God forgive me,"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,4,5,NURSE,8,"Marry, and amen, how sound is she asleep!"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,4,5,NURSE,9,"I must needs wake her. Madam, madam, madam!"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,4,5,NURSE,10,"Ay, let the county take you in your bed;"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,4,5,NURSE,11,"He'll fright you up, i' faith. Will it not be?"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,4,5,NURSE,12,"What, dress'd! and in your clothes! and down again!"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,4,5,NURSE,13,I must needs wake you; Lady! lady! lady!
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,4,5,NURSE,14,"Alas, alas! Help, help! my lady's dead!"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,4,5,NURSE,15,"O, well-a-day, that ever I was born!"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,4,5,NURSE,16,"Some aqua vitae, ho! My lord! my lady!"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,4,5,LADY CAPULET,1,What noise is here?
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,4,5,NURSE,1,O lamentable day!
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,4,5,LADY CAPULET,1,What is the matter?
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,4,5,NURSE,1,"Look, look! O heavy day!"

The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,4,5,CAPULET,2,"Her blood is settled, and her joints are stiff;"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,4,5,CAPULET,3,Life and these lips have long been separated:
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,4,5,CAPULET,4,Death lies on her like an untimely frost
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,4,5,CAPULET,5,Upon the sweetest flower of all the field.
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,4,5,NURSE,1,O lamentable day!

The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,4,5,CAPULET,3,"Hath Death lain with thy wife. There she lies,"

The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,4,5,PARIS,1,"Have I thought long to see this morning's face,"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,4,5,PARIS,2,And doth it give me such a sight as this?
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,4,5,LADY CAPULET,1,"Accursed, unhappy, wretched, hateful day!"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,4,5,LADY CAPULET,2,Most miserable hour that e'er time saw

The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,4,5,FRIAR LAURENCE,3,"Had part in this fair maid; now heaven hath all,"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,4,5,FRIAR LAURENCE,4,And all the better is it for the maid:
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,4,5,FRIAR LAURENCE,5,"Your part in her you could not keep from death,"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,4,5,FRIAR LAURENCE,6,But heaven keeps his part in eternal life.
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,4,5,FRIAR LAURENCE,7,The most you sought was her promotion;
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,4,5,FRIAR LAURENCE,8,For 'twas your heaven she should be advanced:
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,4,5,FRIAR LAURENCE,9,"And weep ye now, seeing she is advanced"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,4,5,FRIAR LAURENCE,10,"Above the clouds, as high as heaven itself?"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,4,5,FRIAR LAURENCE,11,"O, in this love, you love your child so ill,"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,4,5,FRIAR LAURENCE,12,"That you run mad, seeing that she is well:"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,4,5,FRIAR LAURENCE,13,She's not well married that lives married long;
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,4,5,FRIAR LAURENCE,14,But she's best married that dies married young.
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,4,5,FRIAR LAURENCE,15,"Dry up your tears, and stick your rosemary"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,4,5,FRIAR LAURENCE,16,"On this fair corse; and, as the custom is,"

The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,4,5,FRIAR LAURENCE,18,"For though fond nature bids us an lament,"

The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,4,5,CAPULET,5,"Our solemn hymns to sullen dirges change,"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,4,5,CAPULET,6,"Our bridal flowers serve for a buried corse,"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,4,5,CAPULET,7,And all things change them to the contrary.
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,4,5,FRIAR LAURENCE,1,"Sir, go you in; and, madam, go with him;"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,4,5,FRIAR LAURENCE,2,"And go, Sir Paris; every one prepare"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,4,5,FRIAR LAURENCE,3,To follow this fair corse unto her grave:
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,4,5,FRIAR LAURENCE,4,The heavens do lour upon you for some ill;
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,4,5,FRIAR LAURENCE,5,Move them no more by crossing their high will.
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,4,5,FIRST MUSICIAN,1,"Faith, we may put up our pipes, and be gone."
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,4,5,NURSE,1,"Honest goodfellows, ah, put up, put up;"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,4,5,NURSE,2,"For, well you know, this is a pitiful case."
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,4,5,FIRST MUSICIAN,1,"Ay, by my troth, the case may be amended."
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,4,5,PETER,1,"Musicians, O, musicians, 'Heart's ease, Heart's"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,4,5,PETER,2,"ease:' O, an you will have me live, play 'Heart's ease.'"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,4,5,FIRST MUSICIAN,1,Why 'Heart's ease?'
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,4,5,PETER,1,"O, musicians, because my heart itself plays 'My"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,4,5,PETER,2,"heart is full of woe:' O, play me some merry dump,"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,4,5,PETER,3,to comfort me.
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,4,5,FIRST MUSICIAN,1,Not a dump we; 'tis no time to play now.
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,4,5,PETER,1,"You will not, then?"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,4,5,FIRST MUSICIAN,1,No.
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,4,5,PETER,1,I will then give it you soundly.
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,4,5,FIRST MUSICIAN,1,What will you give us?
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,4,5,PETER,1,"No money, on my faith, but the gleek;"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,4,5,PETER,2,I will give you the minstrel.
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,4,5,FIRST MUSICIAN,1,Then I will give you the serving-creature.
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,4,5,PETER,1,Then will I lay the serving-creature's dagger on
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,4,5,PETER,2,"your pate. I will carry no crotchets: I'll re you,"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,4,5,PETER,3,I'll fa you; do you note me?
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,4,5,FIRST MUSICIAN,1,"An you re us and fa us, you note us."
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,4,5,SECOND MUSICIAN,1,"Pray you, put up your dagger, and put out your wit."
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,4,5,PETER,1,Then have at you with my wit! I will dry-beat you
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,4,5,PETER,2,"with an iron wit, and put up my iron dagger. Answer"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,4,5,PETER,3,me like men:
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,4,5,PETER,4,"'When griping grief the heart doth wound,"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,4,5,PETER,5,"And doleful dumps the mind oppress,"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,4,5,PETER,6,Then music with her silver sound'--
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,4,5,PETER,7,why 'silver sound'? why 'music with her silver
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,4,5,PETER,8,"sound'? What say you, Simon Catling?"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,4,5,MUSICIAN,1,"Marry, sir, because silver hath a sweet sound."
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,4,5,PETER,1,"Pretty! What say you, Hugh Rebeck?"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,4,5,SECOND MUSICIAN,1,"I say 'silver sound,' because musicians sound for silver."
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,4,5,PETER,1,"Pretty too! What say you, James Soundpost?"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,4,5,THIRD MUSICIAN,1,"Faith, I know not what to say."
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,4,5,PETER,1,"O, I cry you mercy; you are the singer: I will say"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,4,5,PETER,2,"for you. It is 'music with her silver sound,'"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,4,5,PETER,3,because musicians have no gold for sounding:
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,4,5,PETER,4,'Then music with her silver sound
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,4,5,PETER,5,With speedy help doth lend redress.'
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,4,5,FIRST MUSICIAN,1,What a pestilent knave is this same!
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,4,5,SECOND MUSICIAN,1,"Hang him, Jack! Come, we'll in here; tarry for the"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,4,5,SECOND MUSICIAN,2,"mourners, and stay dinner."
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,5,1,ROMEO,1,"If I may trust the flattering truth of sleep,"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,5,1,ROMEO,2,My dreams presage some joyful news at hand:
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,5,1,ROMEO,3,My bosom's lord sits lightly in his throne;
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,5,1,ROMEO,4,And all this day an unaccustom'd spirit
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,5,1,ROMEO,5,Lifts me above the ground with cheerful thoughts.
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,5,1,ROMEO,6,I dreamt my lady came and found me dead--
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,5,1,ROMEO,7,"Strange dream, that gives a dead man leave"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,5,1,ROMEO,8,to think!--
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,5,1,ROMEO,9,"And breathed such life with kisses in my lips,"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,5,1,ROMEO,10,"That I revived, and was an emperor."
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,5,1,ROMEO,11,"Ah me! how sweet is love itself possess'd,"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,5,1,ROMEO,12,When but love's shadows are so rich in joy!
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,5,1,ROMEO,13,"News from Verona!--How now, Balthasar!"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,5,1,ROMEO,14,Dost thou not bring me letters from the friar?
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,5,1,ROMEO,15,How doth my lady? Is my father well?
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,5,1,ROMEO,16,How fares my Juliet? that I ask again;
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,5,1,ROMEO,17,"For nothing can be ill, if she be well."
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,5,1,BALTHASAR,1,"Then she is well, and nothing can be ill:"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,5,1,BALTHASAR,2,"Her body sleeps in Capel's monument,"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,5,1,BALTHASAR,3,And her immortal part with angels lives.
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,5,1,BALTHASAR,4,"I saw her laid low in her kindred's vault,"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,5,1,BALTHASAR,5,And presently took post to tell it you:
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,5,1,BALTHASAR,6,"O, pardon me for bringing these ill news,"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,5,1,BALTHASAR,7,"Since you did leave it for my office, sir."
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,5,1,ROMEO,1,"Is it even so? then I defy you, stars!"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,5,1,ROMEO,2,"Thou know'st my lodging: get me ink and paper,"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,5,1,ROMEO,3,And hire post-horses; I will hence to-night.
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,5,1,BALTHASAR,1,"I do beseech you, sir, have patience:"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,5,1,BALTHASAR,2,"Your looks are pale and wild, and do import"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,5,1,BALTHASAR,3,Some misadventure.
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,5,1,ROMEO,1,"Tush, thou art deceived:"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,5,1,ROMEO,2,"Leave me, and do the thing I bid thee do."
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,5,1,ROMEO,3,Hast thou no letters to me from the friar?
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,5,1,BALTHASAR,1,"No, my good lord."
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,5,1,ROMEO,1,"No matter: get thee gone,"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,5,1,ROMEO,2,And hire those horses; I'll be with thee straight.
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,5,1,ROMEO,3,"Well, Juliet, I will lie with thee to-night."
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,5,1,ROMEO,4,"Let's see for means: O mischief, thou art swift"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,5,1,ROMEO,5,To enter in the thoughts of desperate men!
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,5,1,ROMEO,6,"I do remember an apothecary,--"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,5,1,ROMEO,7,"And hereabouts he dwells,--which late I noted"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,5,1,ROMEO,8,"In tatter'd weeds, with overwhelming brows,"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,5,1,ROMEO,9,"Culling of simples; meagre were his looks,"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,5,1,ROMEO,10,Sharp misery had worn him to the bones:
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,5,1,ROMEO,11,"And in his needy shop a tortoise hung,"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,5,1,ROMEO,12,"An alligator stuff'd, and other skins"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,5,1,ROMEO,13,Of ill-shaped fishes; and about his shelves
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,5,1,ROMEO,14,"A beggarly account of empty boxes,"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,5,1,ROMEO,15,"Green earthen pots, bladders and musty seeds,"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,5,1,ROMEO,16,"Remnants of packthread and old cakes of roses,"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,5,1,ROMEO,17,"Were thinly scatter'd, to make up a show."
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,5,1,ROMEO,18,"Noting this penury, to myself I said"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,5,1,ROMEO,19,"'An if a man did need a poison now,"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,5,1,ROMEO,20,"Whose sale is present death in Mantua,"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,5,1,ROMEO,21,Here lives a caitiff wretch would sell it him.'
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,5,1,ROMEO,22,"O, this same thought did but forerun my need;"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,5,1,ROMEO,23,And this same needy man must sell it me.
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,5,1,ROMEO,24,"As I remember, this should be the house."
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,5,1,ROMEO,25,"Being holiday, the beggar's shop is shut."
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,5,1,ROMEO,26,"What, ho! apothecary!"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,5,1,APOTHECARY,1,Who calls so loud?
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,5,1,ROMEO,1,"Come hither, man. I see that thou art poor:"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,5,1,ROMEO,2,"Hold, there is forty ducats: let me have"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,5,1,ROMEO,3,"A dram of poison, such soon-speeding gear"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,5,1,ROMEO,4,As will disperse itself through all the veins
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,5,1,ROMEO,5,That the life-weary taker may fall dead
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,5,1,ROMEO,6,And that the trunk may be discharged of breath
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,5,1,ROMEO,7,As violently as hasty powder fired
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,5,1,ROMEO,8,Doth hurry from the fatal cannon's womb.
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,5,1,APOTHECARY,1,Such mortal drugs I have; but Mantua's law
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,5,1,APOTHECARY,2,Is death to any he that utters them.
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,5,1,ROMEO,1,"Art thou so bare and full of wretchedness,"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,5,1,ROMEO,2,"And fear'st to die? famine is in thy cheeks,"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,5,1,ROMEO,3,"Need and oppression starveth in thine eyes,"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,5,1,ROMEO,4,Contempt and beggary hangs upon thy back;
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,5,1,ROMEO,5,The world is not thy friend nor the world's law;
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,5,1,ROMEO,6,The world affords no law to make thee rich;
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,5,1,ROMEO,7,"Then be not poor, but break it, and take this."
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,5,1,APOTHECARY,1,"My poverty, but not my will, consents."
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,5,1,ROMEO,1,"I pay thy poverty, and not thy will."
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,5,1,APOTHECARY,1,"Put this in any liquid thing you will,"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,5,1,APOTHECARY,2,"And drink it off; and, if you had the strength"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,5,1,APOTHECARY,3,"Of twenty men, it would dispatch you straight."
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,5,1,ROMEO,1,"There is thy gold, worse poison to men's souls,"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,5,1,ROMEO,2,"Doing more murders in this loathsome world,"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,5,1,ROMEO,3,Than these poor compounds that thou mayst not sell.
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,5,1,ROMEO,4,I sell thee poison; thou hast sold me none.
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,5,1,ROMEO,5,"Farewell: buy food, and get thyself in flesh."
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,5,1,ROMEO,6,"Come, cordial and not poison, go with me"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,5,1,ROMEO,7,To Juliet's grave; for there must I use thee.
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,5,2,FRIAR JOHN,1,"Holy Franciscan friar! brother, ho!"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,5,2,FRIAR LAURENCE,1,This same should be the voice of Friar John.
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,5,2,FRIAR LAURENCE,2,Welcome from Mantua: what says Romeo?
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,5,2,FRIAR LAURENCE,3,"Or, if his mind be writ, give me his letter."
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,5,2,FRIAR JOHN,1,Going to find a bare-foot brother out
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,5,2,FRIAR JOHN,2,"One of our order, to associate me,"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,5,2,FRIAR JOHN,3,"Here in this city visiting the sick,"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,5,2,FRIAR JOHN,4,"And finding him, the searchers of the town,"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,5,2,FRIAR JOHN,5,Suspecting that we both were in a house
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,5,2,FRIAR JOHN,6,"Where the infectious pestilence did reign,"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,5,2,FRIAR JOHN,7,"Seal'd up the doors, and would not let us forth;"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,5,2,FRIAR JOHN,8,So that my speed to Mantua there was stay'd.
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,5,2,FRIAR LAURENCE,1,"Who bare my letter, then, to Romeo?"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,5,2,FRIAR JOHN,1,"I could not send it,--here it is again,--"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,5,2,FRIAR JOHN,2,"Nor get a messenger to bring it thee,"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,5,2,FRIAR JOHN,3,So fearful were they of infection.
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,5,2,FRIAR LAURENCE,1,"Unhappy fortune! by my brotherhood,"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,5,2,FRIAR LAURENCE,2,The letter was not nice but full of charge
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,5,2,FRIAR LAURENCE,3,"Of dear import, and the neglecting it"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,5,2,FRIAR LAURENCE,4,"May do much danger. Friar John, go hence;"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,5,2,FRIAR LAURENCE,5,"Get me an iron crow, and bring it straight"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,5,2,FRIAR LAURENCE,6,Unto my cell.
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,5,2,FRIAR JOHN,1,"Brother, I'll go and bring it thee."
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,5,2,FRIAR LAURENCE,1,Now must I to the monument alone;
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,5,2,FRIAR LAURENCE,2,Within three hours will fair Juliet wake:
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,5,2,FRIAR LAURENCE,3,She will beshrew me much that Romeo
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,5,2,FRIAR LAURENCE,4,Hath had no notice of these accidents;
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,5,2,FRIAR LAURENCE,5,"But I will write again to Mantua,"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,5,2,FRIAR LAURENCE,6,And keep her at my cell till Romeo come;
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,5,2,FRIAR LAURENCE,7,"Poor living corse, closed in a dead man's tomb!"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,5,3,PARIS,1,"Give me thy torch, boy: hence, and stand aloof:"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,5,3,PARIS,2,"Yet put it out, for I would not be seen."
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,5,3,PARIS,3,"Under yond yew-trees lay thee all along,"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,5,3,PARIS,4,Holding thine ear close to the hollow ground;
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,5,3,PARIS,5,"So shall no foot upon the churchyard tread,"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,5,3,PARIS,6,"Being loose, unfirm, with digging up of graves,"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,5,3,PARIS,7,"But thou shalt hear it: whistle then to me,"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,5,3,PARIS,8,As signal that thou hear'st something approach.
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,5,3,PARIS,9,"Give me those flowers. Do as I bid thee, go."
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,5,3,PAGE,1,Here in the churchyard; yet I will adventure.
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,5,3,PARIS,1,"Sweet flower, with flowers thy bridal bed I strew,--"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,5,3,PARIS,2,O woe! thy canopy is dust and stones;--
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,5,3,PARIS,3,"Which with sweet water nightly I will dew,"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,5,3,PARIS,4,"Or, wanting that, with tears distill'd by moans:"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,5,3,PARIS,5,The obsequies that I for thee will keep
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,5,3,PARIS,6,Nightly shall be to strew thy grave and weep.
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,5,3,PARIS,7,The boy gives warning something doth approach.
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,5,3,PARIS,8,"What cursed foot wanders this way to-night,"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,5,3,PARIS,9,To cross my obsequies and true love's rite?
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,5,3,PARIS,10,"What with a torch! muffle me, night, awhile."
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,5,3,ROMEO,1,Give me that mattock and the wrenching iron.
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,5,3,ROMEO,2,"Hold, take this letter; early in the morning"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,5,3,ROMEO,3,See thou deliver it to my lord and father.
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,5,3,ROMEO,4,"Give me the light: upon thy life, I charge thee,"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,5,3,ROMEO,5,"Whate'er thou hear'st or seest, stand all aloof,"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,5,3,ROMEO,6,And do not interrupt me in my course.
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,5,3,ROMEO,7,"Why I descend into this bed of death,"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,5,3,ROMEO,8,Is partly to behold my lady's face;
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,5,3,ROMEO,9,But chiefly to take thence from her dead finger
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,5,3,ROMEO,10,"A precious ring, a ring that I must use"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,5,3,ROMEO,11,"In dear employment: therefore hence, be gone:"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,5,3,ROMEO,12,"But if thou, jealous, dost return to pry"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,5,3,ROMEO,13,"In what I further shall intend to do,"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,5,3,ROMEO,14,"By heaven, I will tear thee joint by joint"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,5,3,ROMEO,15,And strew this hungry churchyard with thy limbs:
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,5,3,ROMEO,16,"The time and my intents are savage-wild,"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,5,3,ROMEO,17,More fierce and more inexorable far
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,5,3,ROMEO,18,Than empty tigers or the roaring sea.

The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,5,3,PARIS,5,To the dead bodies: I will apprehend him.
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,5,3,PARIS,6,"Stop thy unhallow'd toil, vile Montague!"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,5,3,PARIS,7,Can vengeance be pursued further than death?
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,5,3,PARIS,8,"Condemned villain, I do apprehend thee:"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,5,3,PARIS,9,"Obey, and go with me; for thou must die."

The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,5,3,ROMEO,5,"Put not another sin upon my head,"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,5,3,ROMEO,6,"By urging me to fury: O, be gone!"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,5,3,ROMEO,7,"By heaven, I love thee better than myself;"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,5,3,ROMEO,8,For I come hither arm'd against myself:
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,5,3,ROMEO,9,"Stay not, be gone; live, and hereafter say,"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,5,3,ROMEO,10,A madman's mercy bade thee run away.
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,5,3,PARIS,1,"I do defy thy conjurations,"

The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,5,3,ROMEO,3,"What said my man, when my betossed soul"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,5,3,ROMEO,4,Did not attend him as we rode? I think

The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,5,3,ROMEO,6,Said he not so? or did I dream it so?
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,5,3,ROMEO,7,"Or am I mad, hearing him talk of Juliet,"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,5,3,ROMEO,8,"To think it was so? O, give me thy hand,"

The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,5,3,ROMEO,12,"For here lies Juliet, and her beauty makes"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,5,3,ROMEO,13,This vault a feasting presence full of light.
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,5,3,ROMEO,14,"Death, lie thou there, by a dead man interr'd."
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,5,3,ROMEO,15,How oft when men are at the point of death
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,5,3,ROMEO,16,Have they been merry! which their keepers call

The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,5,3,BALTHASAR,3,"And fearfully did menace me with death,"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,5,3,BALTHASAR,4,If I did stay to look on his intents.
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,5,3,FRIAR LAURENCE,1,"Stay, then; I'll go alone. Fear comes upon me:"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,5,3,FRIAR LAURENCE,2,"O, much I fear some ill unlucky thing."
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,5,3,BALTHASAR,1,"As I did sleep under this yew-tree here,"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,5,3,BALTHASAR,2,"I dreamt my master and another fought,"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,5,3,BALTHASAR,3,And that my master slew him.

The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,5,3,FRIAR LAURENCE,2,"Alack, alack, what blood is this, which stains"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,5,3,FRIAR LAURENCE,3,The stony entrance of this sepulchre?
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,5,3,FRIAR LAURENCE,4,What mean these masterless and gory swords
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,5,3,FRIAR LAURENCE,5,To lie discolour'd by this place of peace?
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,5,3,FRIAR LAURENCE,6,"Romeo! O, pale! Who else? what, Paris too?"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,5,3,FRIAR LAURENCE,7,"And steep'd in blood? Ah, what an unkind hour"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,5,3,FRIAR LAURENCE,8,Is guilty of this lamentable chance!
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,5,3,FRIAR LAURENCE,9,The lady stirs.
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,5,3,JULIET,1,O comfortable friar! where is my lord?
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,5,3,JULIET,2,"I do remember well where I should be,"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,5,3,JULIET,3,And there I am. Where is my Romeo?

The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,5,3,FRIAR LAURENCE,10,I dare no longer stay.
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,5,3,JULIET,1,"Go, get thee hence, for I will not away."
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,5,3,JULIET,2,"What's here? a cup, closed in my true love's hand?"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,5,3,JULIET,3,"Poison, I see, hath been his timeless end:"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,5,3,JULIET,4,"O churl! drunk all, and left no friendly drop"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,5,3,JULIET,5,To help me after? I will kiss thy lips;
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,5,3,JULIET,6,"Haply some poison yet doth hang on them,"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,5,3,JULIET,7,To make die with a restorative.
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,5,3,JULIET,8,Thy lips are warm.
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,5,3,JULIET,1,"Yea, noise? then I'll be brief. O happy dagger!"

The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,5,3,FIRST WATCHMAN,6,"Go, tell the prince: run to the Capulets:"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,5,3,FIRST WATCHMAN,7,Raise up the Montagues: some others search:
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,5,3,FIRST WATCHMAN,8,We see the ground whereon these woes do lie;
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,5,3,FIRST WATCHMAN,9,But the true ground of all these piteous woes
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,5,3,FIRST WATCHMAN,10,We cannot without circumstance descry.

The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,5,3,THIRD WATCHMAN,3,As he was coming from this churchyard side.
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,5,3,FIRST WATCHMAN,1,A great suspicion: stay the friar too.
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,5,3,PRINCE,1,"What misadventure is so early up,"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,5,3,PRINCE,2,That calls our person from our morning's rest?
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,5,3,CAPULET,1,"What should it be, that they so shriek abroad?"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,5,3,LADY CAPULET,1,"The people in the street cry Romeo,"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,5,3,LADY CAPULET,2,"Some Juliet, and some Paris; and all run,"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,5,3,LADY CAPULET,3,With open outcry toward our monument.
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,5,3,PRINCE,1,What fear is this which startles in our ears?

The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,5,3,PRINCE,1,"Come, Montague; for thou art early up,"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,5,3,PRINCE,2,To see thy son and heir more early down.
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,5,3,MONTAGUE,1,"Alas, my liege, my wife is dead to-night;"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,5,3,MONTAGUE,2,Grief of my son's exile hath stopp'd her breath:
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,5,3,MONTAGUE,3,What further woe conspires against mine age?
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,5,3,PRINCE,1,"Look, and thou shalt see."
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,5,3,MONTAGUE,1,O thou untaught! what manners is in this?
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,5,3,MONTAGUE,2,To press before thy father to a grave?

The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,5,3,PRINCE,8,Bring forth the parties of suspicion.
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,5,3,FRIAR LAURENCE,1,"I am the greatest, able to do least,"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,5,3,FRIAR LAURENCE,2,"Yet most suspected, as the time and place"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,5,3,FRIAR LAURENCE,3,Doth make against me of this direful murder;
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,5,3,FRIAR LAURENCE,4,"And here I stand, both to impeach and purge"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,5,3,FRIAR LAURENCE,5,Myself condemned and myself excused.
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,5,3,PRINCE,1,Then say at once what thou dost know in this.
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,5,3,FRIAR LAURENCE,1,"I will be brief, for my short date of breath"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,5,3,FRIAR LAURENCE,2,Is not so long as is a tedious tale.
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,5,3,FRIAR LAURENCE,3,"Romeo, there dead, was husband to that Juliet;"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,5,3,FRIAR LAURENCE,4,"And she, there dead, that Romeo's faithful wife:"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,5,3,FRIAR LAURENCE,5,I married them; and their stol'n marriage-day
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,5,3,FRIAR LAURENCE,6,"Was Tybalt's dooms-day, whose untimely death"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,5,3,FRIAR LAURENCE,7,"Banish'd the new-made bridegroom from the city,"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,5,3,FRIAR LAURENCE,8,"For whom, and not for Tybalt, Juliet pined."
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,5,3,FRIAR LAURENCE,9,"You, to remove that siege of grief from her,"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,5,3,FRIAR LAURENCE,10,Betroth'd and would have married her perforce
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,5,3,FRIAR LAURENCE,11,"To County Paris: then comes she to me,"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,5,3,FRIAR LAURENCE,12,"And, with wild looks, bid me devise some mean"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,5,3,FRIAR LAURENCE,13,"To rid her from this second marriage,"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,5,3,FRIAR LAURENCE,14,Or in my cell there would she kill herself.
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,5,3,FRIAR LAURENCE,15,"Then gave I her, so tutor'd by my art,"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,5,3,FRIAR LAURENCE,16,A sleeping potion; which so took effect
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,5,3,FRIAR LAURENCE,17,"As I intended, for it wrought on her"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,5,3,FRIAR LAURENCE,18,"The form of death: meantime I writ to Romeo,"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,5,3,FRIAR LAURENCE,19,"That he should hither come as this dire night,"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,5,3,FRIAR LAURENCE,20,"To help to take her from her borrow'd grave,"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,5,3,FRIAR LAURENCE,21,Being the time the potion's force should cease.
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,5,3,FRIAR LAURENCE,22,"But he which bore my letter, Friar John,"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,5,3,FRIAR LAURENCE,23,"Was stay'd by accident, and yesternight"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,5,3,FRIAR LAURENCE,24,Return'd my letter back. Then all alone
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,5,3,FRIAR LAURENCE,25,"At the prefixed hour of her waking,"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,5,3,FRIAR LAURENCE,26,Came I to take her from her kindred's vault;
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,5,3,FRIAR LAURENCE,27,"Meaning to keep her closely at my cell,"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,5,3,FRIAR LAURENCE,28,Till I conveniently could send to Romeo:
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,5,3,FRIAR LAURENCE,29,"But when I came, some minute ere the time"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,5,3,FRIAR LAURENCE,30,"Of her awaking, here untimely lay"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,5,3,FRIAR LAURENCE,31,The noble Paris and true Romeo dead.
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,5,3,FRIAR LAURENCE,32,"She wakes; and I entreated her come forth,"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,5,3,FRIAR LAURENCE,33,And bear this work of heaven with patience:
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,5,3,FRIAR LAURENCE,34,But then a noise did scare me from the tomb;
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,5,3,FRIAR LAURENCE,35,"And she, too desperate, would not go with me,"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,5,3,FRIAR LAURENCE,36,"But, as it seems, did violence on herself."
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,5,3,FRIAR LAURENCE,37,All this I know; and to the marriage
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,5,3,FRIAR LAURENCE,38,"Her nurse is privy: and, if aught in this"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,5,3,FRIAR LAURENCE,39,"Miscarried by my fault, let my old life"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,5,3,FRIAR LAURENCE,40,"Be sacrificed, some hour before his time,"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,5,3,FRIAR LAURENCE,41,Unto the rigour of severest law.
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,5,3,PRINCE,1,We still have known thee for a holy man.
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,5,3,PRINCE,2,Where's Romeo's man? what can he say in this?
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,5,3,BALTHASAR,1,I brought my master news of Juliet's death;
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,5,3,BALTHASAR,2,And then in post he came from Mantua
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,5,3,BALTHASAR,3,"To this same place, to this same monument."
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,5,3,BALTHASAR,4,"This letter he early bid me give his father,"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,5,3,BALTHASAR,5,"And threatened me with death, going in the vault,"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,5,3,BALTHASAR,6,I departed not and left him there.
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,5,3,PRINCE,1,Give me the letter; I will look on it.
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,5,3,PRINCE,2,"Where is the county's page, that raised the watch?"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,5,3,PRINCE,3,"Sirrah, what made your master in this place?"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,5,3,PAGE,1,He came with flowers to strew his lady's grave;
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,5,3,PAGE,2,"And bid me stand aloof, and so I did:"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,5,3,PAGE,3,Anon comes one with light to ope the tomb;
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,5,3,PAGE,4,And by and by my master drew on him;
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,5,3,PAGE,5,And then I ran away to call the watch.
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,5,3,PRINCE,1,"This letter doth make good the friar's words,"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,5,3,PRINCE,2,"Their course of love, the tidings of her death:"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,5,3,PRINCE,3,And here he writes that he did buy a poison
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,5,3,PRINCE,4,"Of a poor 'pothecary, and therewithal"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,5,3,PRINCE,5,"Came to this vault to die, and lie with Juliet."
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,5,3,PRINCE,6,Where be these enemies? Capulet! Montague!
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,5,3,PRINCE,7,"See, what a scourge is laid upon your hate,"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,5,3,PRINCE,8,That heaven finds means to kill your joys with love.
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,5,3,PRINCE,9,And I for winking at your discords too
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,5,3,PRINCE,10,Have lost a brace of kinsmen: all are punish'd.
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,5,3,CAPULET,1,"O brother Montague, give me thy hand:"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,5,3,CAPULET,2,"This is my daughter's jointure, for no more"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,5,3,CAPULET,3,Can I demand.
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,5,3,MONTAGUE,1,But I can give thee more:
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,5,3,MONTAGUE,2,For I will raise her statue in pure gold;
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,5,3,MONTAGUE,3,"That while Verona by that name is known,"
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,5,3,MONTAGUE,4,There shall no figure at such rate be set
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,5,3,MONTAGUE,5,As that of true and faithful Juliet.
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,5,3,CAPULET,1,As rich shall Romeo's by his lady's lie;
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,5,3,CAPULET,2,Poor sacrifices of our enmity!
The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet,5,3,PRINCE,1,A glooming peace this morning with it brings;
